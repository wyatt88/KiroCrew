"""Re-verify a produced feature-videos release folder before uploading it.

Answers one question: would the dashboard accept this folder? It recomputes
every hash from the bytes on disk against the signed manifest, and verifies the
manifest's signature against the committed release public key using the same
canonical-JSON rule and the same algorithm the runtime uses.

Read-only: it never writes to the folder and never touches the network, and it
never executes runtime code — which is why the canonical-JSON rule lives in this
tool and a test pins it to the runtime's verifier.

Usage:

    python3 scripts/feature-videos/verify.py dist/feature-videos/0.7.0
