"""``GET /api/agents`` ships an explicit allowlist, never the whole record.

Building each row with ``{**dataclasses.asdict(agent_cfg)}`` would make its
response contract "every field ``KiroCrewAgentConfig`` has, plus every field
anyone adds later", automatically — a field added by someone who never looked
at this endpoint would ship to the browser by omission. Both row sources use an
explicit allowlist instead, mirroring the rule ``handlers/members.py`` already
documents for ``GET /api/members``.

These tests are the half that keeps it converted. The key set is pinned as a
literal, and a separate ratchet compares that literal against the live record
so a field added to ``KiroCrewAgentConfig`` fails here rather than silently
appearing in the response — which is the whole point of the change: the default
becomes "nothing unless someone adds it".
