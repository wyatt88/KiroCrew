"""Release-channel resolution for Dev Fleet's per-lane worktrees.

The defect these tests exist to prevent is a SILENT one: a lane that resolves to
the wrong ref still produces a worktree that builds, boots as a pod and serves a
dashboard, so "stable" showing a prerelease looks exactly like success. Every
assertion below is therefore about the resolver's *answer*, not about whether it
ran.

Tag fixtures use this repository's real tag vocabulary (``v0.5.0``,
``v0.6.0-insider.6``) so a rename of the release workflow's tag shape shows up
here rather than in production.
