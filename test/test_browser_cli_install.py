        **What this asserts, and why it is not a tight ratio.** The bound
        this test exists to defend is the gap between LINEAR and CATASTROPHIC,
        which is the gap between milliseconds and seconds-to-minutes. It does
        not need to resolve 2.0x from 3.0x, and trying to do so is what made it
        flake three separate times:

        * originally, one ``perf_counter`` sample per size — billed for
          whatever the OS gave the sibling xdist workers;
        * then ``thread_time`` + best-of-3, which removed the cross-worker
          noise but not the tick quantization on Windows (~15.625ms steps, so
          6 ticks over 2 ticks reports exactly 3.0 and fails ``< 3.0``);
        * then an adaptive repeat count to clear the tick, which still failed
          CI at **3.07x** on the 3.12 shard — the ONE shard that runs under
          ``--cov``, whose tracer bills every ``re`` call unevenly across the
          two samples while the 3.10 shard (``--no-cov``) passed.

        Measured directly: for genuinely linear code, twelve independent
        best-of-3 ratio measurements on one machine spread **1.53x to 2.50x**.
        A ±0.5 band around 2.0 leaves no room under a 3.0 ceiling, so the
        ratio is measuring scheduler and tracer noise, not scaling.

        So the shape is asserted where the code HAS structure to observe, and
        the timing bound is made generous enough that only catastrophe trips
        it — the rule ``TestIsDeniedReDoSResistance`` and
        ``TestUserRegexReDoSGate`` already follow ("only has to separate
        linear from catastrophic … not assert a sub-100ms wall clock on a
        shared, parallel CI runner"):

        * **Structural half, deterministic:** the pattern is checked to carry
          a bounded quantifier. Catastrophic backtracking on this input needs
          an unbounded one, so its ABSENCE is the actual guarantee — and this
          half cannot flake at all.
        * **Timing half, generously bounded:** doubling the input must not
          cost more than :data:`_CATASTROPHIC_CEILING`. Real quadratic growth
          on 50k chars runs for seconds; the measured linear cost is ~30ms.
