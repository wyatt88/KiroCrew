"""Agent-spec home isolation — the KIRO_HOME seam, the worktree guard, and the
anti-regression guard that keeps ``~/.kiro/agents`` from being hard-coded again.

Regression context: a gateway booted from a linked git worktree rewrote the
machine-wide ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json`` on startup, stamping its own ``.venv``
binary into every managed server's ``command`` and its own data home into their
``env``. The real install's MCP servers then ran the worktree's code and read the
worktree's credential while still calling the live gateway, so every managed MCP
call returned HTTP 403 — and once the worktree was removed those specs pointed at
paths that were gone.
