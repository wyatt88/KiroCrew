"""Regression tests for splitting redaction between load time and display time.

A startup restore that redacts BOTH `content` and `meta` on every message it
loads silently covers for four emit sites that do not
redact. Removing it wholesale then leaked stored content through three further
paths that build model prompts (side-chat, orchestrator stage file, title model).

So the split is asymmetric, and measured:

  content -> still redacted ON LOAD. Only ~0.4s of the ~7s, but ~204 read sites,
             so a single chokepoint is the only holdable invariant.
  meta    -> redacted AT THE EMIT SITES. ~5.5s of the ~7s (tool_input payloads)
             is the real boot cost, and its 31 readers are tractable: outside the
             emit sites every one reads control fields only.

Each emit-site test here fails against the pre-change code for a DIFFERENT site,
so they cannot all be satisfied by re-adding a blanket load-time pass.

The `system` role is the crux of the emit-site half: the write path never redacted
it, the old load path did, and the emit paths did not — so `system` content
reached disk raw and was cleaned only in memory.

    The premise was true for THIS call site and the conclusion was still wrong,
    because `_redact_meta_for_role` has another caller — `_prepare_messages` — where
    the banner is PRE-TERMINAL and the URL is rendered. Pinning the blanking as
    acceptable had frozen the exact behaviour that silently deleted the Authorize
    banner for 8 of the 9 providers in test/oauth_url_corpus.py.

    The lesson worth keeping: a shared helper cannot be judged safe from one call
    site. The gate now matches `security.oauth_url_contains_credential` for every caller.
