"""The live-target pointer stays masked from EVERY sandbox — Dev Fleet's backend included.

The pointer (``live_target.json``) names the checkout the gateway ``execve``s into at
startup, so it is bind-masked from sandboxed processes: a process that could write it
would choose the code the whole host runs next. Dev Fleet's backend is one of those
processes, and it is the process that asks for a cutover (make-live) — so the first version of
this fix carved the leaf back out for that ONE spawn, the way md-notebook's Notes state
is carved out.

That carve-out was a hole, and this file exists to keep it closed: the backend spawns
``npm ci`` / build steps for arbitrary worktrees, a nested sandbox is denied by design,
so those children run inside the backend's namespace — a leaf the backend could write,
a worktree's lifecycle script could write. The cutover therefore moved into the GATEWAY
process (``dev_fleet/gateway_routes.py``, pinned by ``test_dev_fleet_gateway_routes``),
and what the sandbox keeps is:

* the mask, in every mode, on both platform builders, with NO owned-leaf exemption
  for dev-fleet (``_APP_BACKEND_OWNED_LEAVES`` must never list the pointer);
* a MOUNT TARGET for it, materialised before every namespace spawn, because an absent
  file cannot be masked and the crew home root is writable in-sandbox;
* a document that every reader treats exactly as absence, so that stub never surfaces
  as a corrupt pointer.
