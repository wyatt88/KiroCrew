"""Create of a release-channel worktree, and how the fleet publishes it.

Two classes of defect are guarded here, both of which produce a tree that looks
healthy:

* **Resolving stale.** ``create`` must fetch BEFORE resolving. The
  background refresher keeps the fleet ROWS current, but it runs on its own
  schedule — a mutation that resolved first would pin whatever the tag mirror held
  at that moment and report the result as the channel tip.
* **Adopting a tree that is not ours.** ``release-channel-stable`` is a reserved
  name, and a user's own branch checkout under that name must never have its HEAD
  moved. Adoption requires the SHAPE (detached), never the name.

    The trap is that every ORDINARY prune signal says "delete me": detached (so
    no branch and no PR), clean, and holding no commits of its own because a
    release tag is an ancestor of the base branch. That is the ``empty`` verdict,
    and past 48h ``empty`` is a candidate the preview PRESELECTS.

    Both rows below are that state and neither may be offered. The second is the
    one a basename guard could not reach: a tree the operator detached BY HAND at
    a release tag -- the workflow this feature automates -- carries no lane name,
    so a prefix match left it preselected while claiming pins were safe.
