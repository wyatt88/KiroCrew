"""The hardening that rides with the md-notebook backend's mask carve-out.

The carve-out ITSELF is not retested here: ``_APP_BACKEND_OWNED_LEAVES`` names the hidden
leaves the Notes backend owns, ``app_backend_visible_targets`` resolves them, and
``apps/backend.py`` passes them as ``extra_visible_dirs`` for exactly that spawn; a spelling
beneath a foreign mask is refused by ``carveout_shadowed_by_foreign_mask``. Both are pinned
in ``test_sandbox_governance_mask.py``.

What this file pins is what that carve-out OPENS, and the guards that close it. Making the
three state files writable on a sandboxed host for the first time exposed two credential
paths:

* an ABSENT leaf gets no mask at all — ``mount(2)`` cannot target a missing path and the
  launcher's hiding loops guard on existence — so an agent namespace spawned before the
  first vault attach reads the PAT saved after it;
* the state writers staged their temp BESIDE the target, so a file holding the real PAT
  bytes sat at a name none of the three leaf masks covers, and a SIGKILL between write and
  rename left it readable by a same-uid agent forever.

The answers are :func:`sandbox._materialize_md_notebook_mask_targets` and the masked
top-level ``md-notebook-staging`` directory every state writer now publishes through.
