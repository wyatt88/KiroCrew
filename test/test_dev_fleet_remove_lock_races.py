"""Regression tests for two concurrency races in Dev Fleet worktree removal.

Race: removal during rebase
  ``_worktree_remove`` must refuse immediately when ``_wt_lock(name)`` is
  already held by a running rebase, rather than letting the deletion proceed
  and corrupt the rebase's working directory.

Race: make-live staging between protection check and deletion
  The direct worktree-removal path must hold ``_MAKE_LIVE_LOCK`` from the
  live/staged protection re-check through ``git worktree remove``, so a
  concurrent ``/make-live`` cannot stage the target in that window.

For each race the tests:
  1. Verify the production fix blocks the race (the fix is present → refuse).
  2. Prove the test FAILS without the fix by temporarily undoing the guard and
     re-running the key assertion (the fix is absent → the race proceeds
     undetected).  Each test uses a ``_verify_fails_without_fix`` helper to
     keep the proof deterministic and self-contained.

All infrastructure is injected: no real git, no subprocess, no network.
