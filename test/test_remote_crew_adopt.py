"""Adopt an EXISTING peer session into a local slot (teleport-to-local).

``POST /api/chat/slots`` with ``adopt_remote_slot`` binds a FRESH local slot to a
peer session the crew already holds, instead of minting an empty one over there.
Clicking a peer row in the merged Sessions list then opens that conversation in
the local pane — local transcript, local composer — with turns executing on the
peer.

Three things make that a different problem from a mint, and they are what this
file pins:

* the peer key is **caller-supplied**, so it is untrusted — validated against the
  same live-session view the sidebar renders, which is what refuses a forged key
  and a slot this hub already drives with one check;
* the local slot inherits **the peer's** ``agent`` / ``title`` / ``memory_mode``,
  the last of which is a privacy boundary and must never be defaulted here;
* the peer already **has a history**, so it is copied in once at birth — and that
  copy is best-effort, because a slot that opens with a notice instead of its
  history is usable while a create that 502s over a slow read leaves the user
  nothing.

The ``remote_already_bound`` 409 is asserted NOT to fire (an adopt makes a fresh
slot, and that guard exists only to stop a LIVE LOCAL session's execution being
moved to an empty peer slot), and the hub-driven dedupe is asserted to drop the
peer's own row once the adopt lands — which is what keeps one conversation from
rendering as two rows.
