# Feature Map

One table per area, mapping every user-facing dashboard feature to **how a user
reaches it** and **where its code lives**. It exists so that "which page and
which handler own this?" is a lookup rather than a search, for a human or an
agent landing cold on a feature.

It is a **navigation index, not a contract**. Behavior contracts live in
[`../system-specs/`](../system-specs/README.md); this file says where to go and
deliberately says nothing about how a feature works.

## Maintenance contract

**A pull request that ADDS or REMOVES a feature updates this map in the same
PR. A pull request that only changes how an existing feature behaves does
not.** That line is drawn where it is because a map re-reviewed on every edit
stops being read: the cost has to land on the change that actually invalidates
a row.

`scripts/check_feature_map.py` enforces the mechanical half. It reads the
`base..HEAD` diff and fails only when a file is **added or deleted** under
`website/src/pages/` or `src/kiro_crew/dashboard/handlers/`, or a `<Route>`
entry is added or removed in `website/src/App.tsx`, while this file is
untouched. Editing existing files never trips it. The job row is in
[../ci/ci-and-reviews.md](../ci/ci-and-reviews.md).

The judgment half is reviewer-owned: the blocking `feature-map-correctness`
rule in root `AUTOSDE.yaml` verifies each changed row against the code diff and
rejects unrelated or cosmetic map churn. The mechanical check cannot tell
whether a row's *content* is still true, only that a structural change went by
without anyone looking at the map. When the check fires and the honest answer
is "no feature changed", update the row the new file belongs to so its columns
remain truthful; a whitespace or cosmetic edit does not count.

## How to read this

- **Reach it** is the user's path, written as the URL plus the tab or control
  that gets there. `?tab=` and `?view=` are real query parameters the page
  parses, not shorthand.
- **Page** is relative to `website/src/`.
- **Handler** is relative to `src/kiro_crew/dashboard/`. Two areas live outside
  that root and are written in full.
- **Endpoints** are 2–4 representative routes, not the complete set. The full
  table is `src/kiro_crew/dashboard/routes/` plus the direct registrations in
  `dashboard/server.py`; `test/test_dashboard_route_table.py` pins its order.
- `TODO(verify)` marks a cell nobody has confirmed against code. Fix it or
  leave it; never replace it with a guess.

Sidebar entries come from `website/src/surfaces/builtins.tsx`, which is the
authoritative nav table (label, group, badge, preview gate). A surface marked
`hiddenFromNav` there has a working route but no rail row — it is reached from
somewhere else, noted per row below.

## Chat and sessions

The default destination. `/chat` is the rail's **Sessions** row; everything in
this area is reached from inside it unless stated otherwise.

| Feature | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sessions | Multi-slot agent chat, one slot per conversation; pinned rows form a manually ordered section above automatic sorting | `/chat/:slug?` — rail **Sessions** | `pages/ChatPage.tsx`, `pages/ChatSidebar.tsx`, `pages/chat/SessionFlyout.tsx`, `pages/chat/TranscriptScrollShell.tsx` (internal split of ChatPage — the transcript scroller skeleton, no new user-facing feature), `pages/chat/ChatPageMessageContent.tsx` (internal split of ChatPage — the header menu, row-key helpers and user-bubble content renderers, no new user-facing feature), `pages/chat/useChatPageTranscriptController.tsx` (internal split of ChatPage — scroll-to-bottom, auto-follow gating, nav scrolling and the pinned-prompt banner, no new user-facing feature), `pages/chat/useChatPageSessionController.ts` (internal split of ChatPage — session identity, `?sid` URL sync, session tabs and slot auto-create, no new user-facing feature), `pages/chat/useChatPageResourcesController.tsx` (internal split of ChatPage — side-panel tabs, source/issue selection, file/folder/artifact/diff opening, uploads, screen snips and drops, no new user-facing feature), `pages/chat/hoverHold.ts` (internal split of ChatSidebar — seat arithmetic for the hovered-row hold, no new user-facing feature), `pages/chat/CompactionCard.tsx` (transcript row for the gateway's compaction / session-reload status notices — folds the compaction summary behind a one-line card instead of an assistant bubble; no new user-facing entry point), `pages/chat/transientNotice.ts` (helper for the existing error row — resolves the gateway's transient-retry `meta.notice` token into localized NoticeCard / ErrorCard copy; no new user-facing entry point), `utils/pinnedSessionOrder.ts` | `chat_handlers.py`, `ws.py` | `POST /api/chat`, `GET,POST /api/chat/slots`, `GET /api/ws` |
| Sessions page | A neutral, bookmarkable session chooser at a stable URL — lists open sessions with search, filter chips (All / Unread / tags) and recency groups; never auto-selects or auto-creates a session, unlike bare `/chat` | `/sessions` — typed or bookmarked URL only (deliberately no nav-rail entry; pending a maintainer call) | `pages/SessionsPage.tsx`, `pages/chat/sessionOrder.ts` (shared ordering with the sidebar) | none new — reads the same SSE slots frames and existing handlers | `GET /api/ws` (`slots`), `GET /api/chat/tags`, `POST /api/chat/slots` (New session) |
| Default memory mode | Picks Persistent, Incognito, or Temporary for new dashboard-created chats; explicit per-chat choices win, while app-owned and direct API sessions keep their own mode | Settings → Chat → **Default Memory Mode**; the Welcome view can override one chat | `pages/settings/ChatPanel.tsx`, `store/chatSlice.ts`, `components/WelcomeView.tsx` | `handlers/files.py` (`api_dashboard_config`), `chat_handlers.py`, `remote_relay.py` | `GET,PUT /api/dashboard/config`, `POST /api/chat/slots` |
| Remote-bound session | A local session whose turns execute on a connected peer crew and stream back over its tunnel — local sidebar row, transcript and history, remote execution | New-chat menu → **New chat on crew** → pick a connected crew | `pages/ChatPage.tsx`, `pages/ChatSidebar.tsx`, `components/RemoteCrewChip.tsx` | `chat_handlers.py`, `handlers_instances.py`, `handlers/core.py`, `remote_relay.py`, `remote_mirror.py` | `POST /api/chat/slots` (`instance_id`), `POST /api/chat?relay=1`, `GET /api/instances/{id}/capabilities`, `GET /api/version` |
| Peer-owned live session | The OPPOSITE direction of travel from the row above: a session a connected peer crew owns, merged read-only into this machine's live Sessions list and ordered with local rows by recency, badged with the owning crew. Clicking one opens it HERE: the hub binds a fresh local slot to that peer session and backfills the peer's transcript into it, so the row opens a real local conversation whose turns keep running on the peer. The bound row keeps the identity the peer row had (`<instance_id>:<peer_key>`), so it re-renders in place instead of appearing as a second row. The row still omits rename, close, pin, folders, drag and the ⋯ group, because the peer — not this machine — owns the session itself. An adopted session drops out of the peer rows, so it is never listed twice. Board view stays local and reports the count it filtered. The peer's CLOSED sessions are not here; they are reachable only through federated history search | Settings → Developer → Feature Previews → **Remote instance sessions** (default off), then rail **Sessions** | `pages/ChatSidebar.tsx`, `hooks/useInstanceSessions.ts`, `components/RemoteCrewChip.tsx`, `pages/settings/FeaturePreviewsSection.tsx` | `handlers_instances.py`, `chat_handlers.py`, `remote_adopt.py`, `slot_projection.py` | `GET /api/instances/{id}/chat-slots` (owner-only, GET-only; reads the peer's `GET /api/chat/slots`, drops the slots this hub itself drives, then allowlists each row to the fields the sidebar reads and re-redacts its text — a peer's session title is model-authored on another machine, and the local rows beside it are scrubbed by `slot_projection.py`), `POST /api/chat/slots` (`adopt_remote_slot` — binds a fresh local slot to the peer session named by a row of the listing above, and backfills its transcript; refuses with `adopt_peer_mode_unknown` when the crew reports no `memory_mode`, rather than guessing the session's privacy boundary) |
| Session folders | User-defined folders grouping session rows; a folder holding no sessions can optionally drop its body so it costs one row instead of two | Sidebar folder header → drag a row; folder ⋯ menu → New ephemeral chat (incognito / temporary) to start a mode-pinned session in the folder; Settings → Chat → **Compact Empty Folders** (off by default) | `pages/chat/FolderPanel.tsx`, `pages/ChatSidebar.tsx`, `pages/settings/ChatPanel.tsx`, `pages/chat/ChatSettings.tsx` | `chat_folders.py`, `chat_handlers.py` | `GET,POST /api/chat/folders`, `PATCH /api/chat/slots/{slot}/folder`, `POST /api/chat/slots` |
| Session tags | Colored labels on sessions, filterable | Sidebar row context menu → Tags | `pages/chat/SessionFlyout.tsx` | `chat_tags.py` | `GET,POST /api/chat/tags`, `PUT /api/chat/slots/{slot}/tags` |
| Older sessions | The sidebar's history pane, searchable, with per-session delete and a bulk **Delete all** | Sidebar → **Older Sessions** disclosure | `pages/ChatSidebar.tsx` | `handlers/sessions.py` | `GET /api/sessions` (`exclude_open`), `GET /api/sessions/search`, `GET /api/sessions/{key}`, `DELETE /api/sessions/{key}`, `DELETE /api/sessions`, `GET /api/sessions/clearable/count` |
| Pinned messages | Pin a message; pins panel per session | Message hover → pin; header pin count | `pages/chat/PinnedMessagesPanel.tsx` | `chat_pins.py` | `GET,POST /api/chat/pins`, `DELETE /api/chat/pins/{id}` |
| Pinned prompt banner | Keeps the turn's own prompt visible in a single-state banner at the top of a long reply while it scrolls; distinct from **Pinned messages** above. Worn by the main chat AND by every `ChatPane` host — split-view panes and the Crew Members DM thread — through the same hook | Settings → Chat → **Pin the latest turn** | `pages/chat/PinnedPrompt.tsx`, `pages/chat/usePinnedPrompt.ts` (internal split of `useChatPageTranscriptController` — the host-agnostic pin geometry, scroll recompute and in-place jump shared with `components/ChatPane.tsx`; no new user-facing entry point), `app-sdk/ChatMessageList.tsx` (`onDisplayItems` / `hiddenRow` row-indexing seam) | client-only (no handler) | none |
| Turn minimap | A proportional, non-scrolling rail of markers in the transcript's left gutter, one per loaded user message with non-empty content (an image-only send counts, since it persists as image markdown; earlier, not-yet-loaded history has no markers — while the server still holds older rows the rail wears a dimmed end-cap that says so and loads them on click); on-screen turns are highlighted, hovering previews the prompt and the final assistant reply before the next turn opener (a user or injected message), and click / arrow keys jump to that turn (Escape closes the preview). Desktop-only by design | Session transcript → left gutter; appears when the viewport is at least the `md` breakpoint (768px), the pane is ≥ 560px wide with ≥ 40px of free gutter beside the content column, there are two or more turns, and the primary pointer is not coarse (`(pointer: coarse)` — touch — hides it; a hover-capable stylus counts as fine) | `pages/chat/TurnNavigationMinimap.tsx` (mounted by `pages/ChatPage.tsx`; items from `hooks/useChatNavigation.ts`) | client-only (no handler) | none |
| Collapse the message input | Puts the composer away while you read a long reply and hands the room to the transcript (measured 89px at 1500x950); a labelled bar stands in its place, reports the unsent draft’s first line, and restores it. Off by default, and the choice persists. Collapses the opposite end of the same reply from the **Pinned prompt banner** above | Composer **+** menu → **Collapse the message input**; on touch, the **⋯** overflow beside the attach button | `components/ChatInput.tsx` (opted in by `pages/ChatPage.tsx`; focus intents resolve through `pages/chat/composerFocus.ts`) | client-only (no handler) | none |
| Share message as card | Turn an assistant reply into a branded PNG card + prefilled caption for X/LinkedIn; governed by `capabilities.social_share` (a policy pin withdraws the entry) | Message hover → More actions → Share as image | `pages/chat/share/ShareMessageModal.tsx`, `pages/chat/share/ShareCard.tsx` (helpers: `pages/chat/share/shareSupport.ts`) | `dashboard/social_share.py` (governance probe; card itself is client-side) | `GET /api/dashboard/config` (`social_share_enabled`) |
| Fork a session | Branch a new slot from an existing transcript; an incognito or temporary session forks into a child of the same memory mode | Session row menu → Fork | `pages/ChatSidebar.tsx` | `chat_fork.py` | `POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/fork` |
| Rewind | Drop the transcript back to an earlier turn | Message action → Rewind | `pages/chat/AssistantMessage.tsx` | `chat_rewind.py` | `POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/rewind` |
| Regenerate / variants | Re-run a turn, keep and switch between answers | Message action → Regenerate | `pages/chat/AssistantMessage.tsx` | `chat_regenerate.py` | `POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/regenerate`, `.../switch-variant`, `.../edit-resend` |
| Session title | Auto-generated and hand-editable slot titles | Header title → click to rename | `pages/ChatSidebar.tsx` | `chat_title.py` | `POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/generate-title`, `PATCH .../title` |
| Session summary | Right-panel rolling summary of the conversation | Chat right panel → **Summary** tab | `pages/chat/SessionSummaryTab.tsx` | `chat_handlers.py` | `GET,POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/summary` |
| Side chat | A scratch sub-conversation beside the main turn; read-only lookups (file reads, searches, fetches, read-only shell) run there without asking on the kiro-cli backend, changes are refused | Chat right panel → **Side**; `/side` or `/btw` in the composer; **Ask about this** on selected assistant text (main chat, split-view panes, Members threads — the seam is `chat-core/composer/selectionActions.ts`) | `pages/chat/SideChat.tsx`, `pages/chat/SidePanel.tsx`, `pages/members/MembersPage.tsx` (detail drawer's Side Chat view) | `handlers/side.py` | `POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/side/open`, `.../side/turn`, `.../side/close` |
| Channel mirroring | Mirror a session into Slack / Discord / other channel | Header channel menu → Link channel | `pages/chat/ChatSettings.tsx` | `chat_mirror.py`, `chat_slack.py` | `POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/mirror-link`, `.../slack-link`, `GET /api/chat/channel-targets` |
| Voice reply and dictation | TTS on replies; streaming mic transcription | Composer mic; Reply → More actions → Read aloud; Settings → Voice | `components/ChatInput.tsx`, `components/VoicePlaybackNotice.tsx`, `pages/chat/AssistantMessage.tsx` | `chat_voice.py`, `stt_stream.py` | `POST /api/voice/synthesize`, `POST /api/voice/cancel`, `GET /api/voice/system-voices`, `GET /api/ws/stt`, `POST /api/stt/transcribe` |
| Tool approvals | Approve or deny a tool call the agent proposes | Inline card in the transcript | `components/ApprovalCard.tsx` | `handlers/sessions.py` | `GET /api/approvals`, `POST /api/approvals/{id}/{action}` |
| Question cards | Agent asks a multiple-choice question in chat; a loop's buried `[OPTIONS:]` decision re-surfaces as a "Waiting on you" card until answered or dismissed | Inline card in the transcript; "Waiting on you" card pinned above the composer | `components/PendingQuestionCard.tsx`, `components/PendingDecisionCard.tsx` | `handlers/ask_question.py` | `POST /api/ask-question`, `GET /api/ask-question/pending`, `POST /api/ask-question/{ask_id}/answer`, `POST /api/pending-decision/dismiss` |
| Files in chat | Browse, attach and upload workspace files | Chat left rail → files; composer attach | `pages/chat/FileBrowserRail.tsx`, `pages/chat/FilesHomePanel.tsx` | `handlers/files.py` | `GET /api/file-read`, `POST /api/upload`, `POST /api/upload/file` |
| Workspace panel controls and fullscreen | Fixed chat-workspace controls for opening the workspace panel, opening the terminal panel, and expanding the whole workspace without remounting its tabs, editors or terminal panes | `/chat/:slug?` → top-right workspace controls; workspace panel → fullscreen button | `App.tsx`, `components/PanelToggles.tsx`, `components/WorkspacePanelContext.ts`, `hooks/useWorkspaceFullscreenPanel.ts`, `pages/chat/SidePanel.tsx` | client-only (no handler) | none |
| Terminal panel | Two shells on the gateway host: an app-wide docked PTY, and a per-chat terminal whose tab lives in that chat's panel state (opens on the chat's working dir; switches with the session) | Header terminal toggle (docked); chat right panel → **+** menu → **Terminal** (per-chat) | `components/BottomTerminalPanel.tsx`, `pages/chat/SidePanel.tsx` | `handlers/terminal.py` | `POST /api/terminal/sessions`, `GET /api/ws/terminal/{session_id}` |
| Browser panel | Live in-panel browser the agent drives; the non-native address bar opens a real website in it; **Annotate** (desktop) picks page elements, takes a note per element in the panel, and adds them to chat with the agent's `eN` refs (`browser:annotate` IPC, `electron/browser-annotate.js`) | Right panel → **Browser** | `components/WebPreviewPanel.tsx` | `handlers/messaging.py` | `GET /api/browser/view`, `POST /api/browser/view/start`, `POST /api/browser/open`, `POST /api/browser/command`, `POST /api/browser/command-result` |
| App-contributed panel tabs | Side-panel tabs an installed app declares in `contributes.panelTabs`; each mounts the app's own ESM bundle as the tab body through the in-process app host. Only enabled apps contribute, and no app means no rows | Chat right panel → **+** menu → the app's row; on an empty panel, its launcher card. Also under `/members` — the Crew Members side panel is the same `SidePanel`, so an app's row appears in its **+** menu once the member's thread is confirmed | `pages/chat/SidePanel.tsx`, `hooks/panelTabRegistry.ts`, `components/AppHost.tsx` | `src/kiro_crew/apps/routes.py` | `GET /api/apps`, `GET /apps/{name}/ui/{path}` |
| Route-history Back / Forward | Browser-style Back and Forward over the dashboard's own route history (desktop layout; on desktop a session switch pushes an entry, so it retraces sessions as well as pages). Each arrow disables when there is nowhere to go (the Forward watermark persists per tab in `sessionStorage` across a reload; it is discarded on a fresh navigation, and a cross-document Back/Forward return (or a BFCache restore) collapses the watermark to the current entry — persisted, so a reload cannot resurrect it — until an in-app navigation re-establishes the frontier — so Forward never leaves the dashboard) and every step asks the page's draft guard before an unarmed pop can unmount typed work | Topbar left cluster → **Back** / **Forward** arrows; `⌘←` / `⌘→` on macOS, `Ctrl+←` / `Ctrl+→` elsewhere (registry ids `history-back` / `history-forward`; left to text fields and terminals, claimed as a no-op on narrow viewports where the arrows are hidden) | `components/NavHistoryArrows.tsx`, `lib/routeHistoryPosition.ts`, `components/NavigationLeaveGuard.tsx` (`useGuardedHistoryStep`), `hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`, `lib/shortcutRegistry.ts` | client-only (no handler) | none |
| Notifications | Bell feed of agent-pushed notifications | Topbar bell → `/notifications` | `pages/NotificationsPage.tsx` | `handlers/messaging.py`, `handlers/notifications_push.py` | `GET /api/notifications`, `POST /api/notifications/ack`, `POST /api/notifications/push` |
| Crew Members | One durable pinned DM thread per crew member, with the chat page's tabbed SidePanel docked beside it (permanent, no close control on wide windows; an overlay on narrow ones) whose first tab is the member's Crew summary, followed by the chat panel's pinned Artifacts and Files tabs, with the + menu offering its remaining views (Terminal / Browser / Side chat / Subagents / Workflows / Git, plus Logs / Context in Developer Mode) and any app-contributed panel tabs against the DM slot — all withheld until the thread endpoint confirms the slot, and Changes (pinned on the chat page) / Issues / Links / Pins / session Summary withheld outright (no transcript index feeds them here); the Crew summary folds the member's recent activity by calendar day (counts per day, project, a time strip behind each row, floors when the log is capped), lists the worker sessions the member is driving (live `slots` frames filtered on `created_by`) and the member's auto-patrol status — the nudge loop on its own `member-<slug>` slot (active / stopped with reason / none), with a roster avatar badge only while a loop is ACTIVE (a stopped loop and a never-armed member both show no badge — the stop reason lives in the Crew summary tab); active patrols also list under Wake sources; the roster carries a per-crew star (persisted on the crew record) and, in the sidebar's search row's sort/filter menu, persistent filters — starred-only, live state (working / needs you / unread / patrolling), origin (mine / built-in / from packages) — and a sort (recent activity / name), so the package-installed crews the agent sync writes can be collapsed. The panel's Side tab is the thread's **Side Chat** surface (selection toolbar → Ask about this lands there; its draft persists per slot in the chat-core store). **Hire** (`POST /api/members`, zero-config: only the source is required): hires a member from a local Custom Agent file or from a **store template** (a card an enabled installed app offers in its manifest's `crew.templates`: role, one-line duty, tags, category, starter prompts, a ghost face; `source: {kind: "store", app, agent}`) — the server names it after its role (else the file) when no `display_name` is sent and records `named_by_user: false` on the row (the first rename flips it; a defaulted name that collides gets `-2` / `#2`, a typed one is still 409), copies the chosen template into the member's OWN agent file and publishes the row already bound to it, in one atomic config-lock hold (a failed copy leaves no member; a row that fails to persist unwinds the copy; no moment exists where the row is bound to the shared source); a store hire also records `template`/`template_version` on the row, copies the card's ghost face onto it, writes the pristine copy `trust/member-templates/<member id>.json` (id-keyed, stamped with the member's store generation) and seeds the member's briefing once; the drawer's Agent template row reads `reviewer — customized copy` for such a member and its Source row `Template triage from Oncall pack (v1.2.0)` for a template-hired one (the app by display name; an `ErrorNotice` when the apps read fails); **Hire gallery** (design step 6, `/members/hire`, the rail still on Crew Members): the one hire entry point, listing every template from installed apps' cards, the shipped built-ins and the user's local agent files (`GET /api/members/templates`) with scenario chips, ghost-avatar cards (role · duty · three tags · Hire / Open chat + Hire another / Hire team ×N) and a detail layer (description, Try asking starters, Built-in capabilities, a quiet publisher · version · origin line); Hire is zero-config and lands in the new member's thread, whose header says *Just hired · named after its role* and renames in place (pencil → input, Enter saves `display_name`); the empty thread shows the member's duty and up to three starter prompts whose Ask sends through the pane (ChatPane `emptyState`); the Crew summary is an ordered section array — Briefing (`GET /api/members/{slug}/briefing`) → Capabilities → Role template (store-hired members: the update offer and detach, in the open drawer) → Activity → Sessions → Auto patrol → Wake sources → Configuration folded behind a disclosure; roster rows wear the member's ghost and a compact source badge (pack name, version in the title); **Role update / detach** (design step 4): in the Role template section a template-hired member reads *Template up to date (vX)* or *<App> vY is available* with **Review update** — a dialog listing the fields the template changed (applied), the fields the user changed (kept) and the fields both changed (the user picks a side; Apply stays disabled until every conflict has one) against the member's pristine copy as BASE — and **Detach from template** (two-step; provenance cleared, everything else kept, one-way); **Fire** (design step 5, at the foot of the drawer, never for the default member): two-step, archives the thread (closed like a tab, transcript in History), activity, briefing and rules to `members/.retired/` with a `fired.json`, removes the row, agent file and pristine copy and archives the private memory; an explicit purge tick deletes the lived state and the transcript instead, the panel hands back to the roster the moment the fire completes, and the outcome (thread archived / deleted / kept because the history path refused / none) is said there in a dismissible notice | `/members` — rail row when the crew preview is on; roster header → **Add member** and the empty roster's call to action → `/members/hire` (the gallery); also the sidebar create menu → **Crew Members** (always shown, its own separator group): with the preview on it opens `/members`, with it off it deep-links to Settings → Developer → Feature Previews with the Crew Members card ringed (`settingsPath` + `useSettingHighlight`, id `developer.crew-members`). **Identity**: a member is addressed everywhere by its immutable **id** (the `agents` key, minted once from the display name typed at creation — the `agents` key grammar; a legacy key outside it is re-keyed on the first load after upgrade, the old key kept as the row's `legacy_key` and its private memory re-attributed), and shown by its **display name** (`display_name`, renameable in the crew editor without touching the id, the thread, the memory or the slug) with a **role** line (`role`, the wrapper's job title, also editable); the roster reads the display name (and role); the drawer's Member id row shows the id, and the crew manager's cards, list rows and editor title carry it as a mono twin beside the label. The open member rides `?member=<id>` (a bare `/members` opens the remembered member, else the first row; below md it stays the roster); select text in a member reply → **Quote** / **Ask about this** | `pages/members/MembersPage.tsx`, `pages/members/HireGalleryPage.tsx` (the gallery), `pages/members/MemberThreadExtras.tsx` (rename affordance, DM empty state), `pages/members/drawerSections.tsx` (the drawer's ordered sections, Briefing, Capabilities), `pages/members/RoleUpdatePanel.tsx` (role update + detach), `pages/members/FirePanel.tsx` (fire), `pages/members/rosterFilter.ts` (internal split of MembersPage — the pure filter/sort model over the roster array, no new user-facing feature), `components/listShell.ts` + `components/SearchFilterBar.tsx` (the Sessions sidebar's card / row / search-row recipes, shared so the two lists read as one surface), `pages/members/activityDays.ts` (pure helpers: fold the activity log by local day, label days, cap floors — no feature of its own), `pages/chat/SidePanel.tsx` (`leadingTab`), `hooks/usePanelDocumentActions.ts`, `components/autoNudgeLoop.ts` (shared cycle/countdown readouts) | `handlers/members.py` (`api_member_hire`, `api_member_templates`, `api_member_briefing_get`), `member_gallery.py` (the catalog), `agent_discovery.py` (`source`: kirocrew / builtin / app / package / local), `member_templates.py` (store template resolve, pristine copy, briefing seed, the role-update three-way merge), `apps/manifest.py` (`CrewConfig`), `handlers/agents.py` (`starred`; `_create_crew(copy_source=…)` + `_write_private_copy` and `_delete_crew_record`, the cores the hire composes), `slot_projection.py` (`created_by`), `handlers/autonudge.py` (registry read), `handlers/side.py` (Side Chat) | `GET /api/members`, `POST /api/members`, `GET /api/members/templates`, `GET /api/members/{slug}/briefing`, `GET,POST /api/members/{member}/role-update`, `POST /api/members/{member}/detach`, `POST /api/members/{member}/fire`, `POST /api/members/{slug}/thread`, `GET /api/members/{slug}/activity`, `GET,PUT /api/members/{slug}/rules`, `PUT /api/agents/{name}` (`starred`), `GET /api/autonudge`, `GET /api/ws` (`slots`, `autonudge_state`), `POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/side/*` |
| Channels | Group rooms with several agents in one thread | `/channels` (builtin app surface) | `pages/ChannelPage.tsx` | `handlers_channel.py` | `GET,POST /api/channels`, `POST /api/channels/{id}/messages`, `POST /api/channels/{id}/agents` |

The Notifications surface is registered `hiddenFromNav`: its route and badge
stay wired, but it is entered from the topbar bell rather than a rail row.

## Agent Capabilities

One destination, pinned to the bottom of the rail, hosting eight tabs. Every tab
is a `?tab=` value on `/capabilities` (`pages/CapabilitiesPage.tsx`).

Any one of those tabs can also be **promoted to its own top-level rail row**, so
a sub-item someone uses daily is one click away instead of two. Each tab is
registered as a `pinnable` surface (`surfaces/builtins.tsx`,
`surfaces/registry.ts`), which keeps it OFF the rail until the user promotes it;
the promoted set is a per-browser preference held under `mc-nav-pinned` and
owned by `lib/navPinned.ts` (the sibling of `lib/appNavHidden.ts`, which does
the same job for app rows in the Apps group). Reach it from the pin control in
the Agent Capabilities page header (`components/PinSurfaceButton.tsx`), which
resolves its subject from the current `?tab=` value. Promotions are capped at
`NAV_PINNED_LIMIT`, and the rail applies the filter in `App.tsx`. No handler and
no endpoint: the preference never leaves the browser.

| Tab | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Crews | Named agent bindings — which agent, model and workspace, keyed by an immutable member **id** minted from the **display name** the form takes at creation (`POST /api/agents` answers `{name: <id>}`; `display_name` and `role` are the renameable label and job title, edited later through `PUT /api/agents/{name}` without re-keying anything); per-crew custom avatar (hand-picked ghost traits and an optional per-state preset sound, edited in the crew editor's avatar builder, or an uploaded picture; a crew can also wear an appearance pack, picked on the builder's Library tab — see Crew appearance library). The preset sound is accepted on every tier; the record also accepts per-state ghost reaction `motions` (backend contract only — no picker edits them and no player draws them yet); the definition panel forks a private template copy on first edit (`components/crew/AgentTemplateDetail.tsx`) | `/capabilities?tab=crews` | `pages/KiroCrewAgentsPage.tsx`, `components/CrewAvatarBuilder.tsx`, `components/CrewAvatarLibraryTab.tsx`, `components/CrewAvatar.tsx`, `lib/appearancePacks/` | `handlers/agents.py` | `GET,PUT /api/config/default-agent`, `POST /api/agents`, `PUT,DELETE /api/agents/{name}`, `GET,POST /api/agents/{name}/avatar`, `POST /api/agents/detail/{name}/fork`, `POST /api/agents/detail/{name}/publish`, `POST /api/agents/detail/{name}/reset` |
| Crew appearance library | The dashboard's own library of appearance packs — art AND per-state sound cues — a crew can wear, rooted at `<data home>/appearance-library/`. Separate from Crew Companion's library: that app is independent and keeps its own packs; the two share only the pack format, so a pack exported from the Companion gallery imports here unchanged. A crew record names a pack as `avatar: {"kind":"pack","id":...}`, and the API can list, read, import, PetDex-fetch and delete packs; deleting a pack a crew wears is refused by name unless forced. The crew editor's avatar builder carries the picker on a **Library** tab: a grid of cards (thumbnail read through the per-slot route, name, author, built-in/custom badge, format), an "Import pack (.json)…" control that posts an exported bundle, and a two-click delete on a custom pack whose 409 names the crews still wearing it (`?force=1` is deliberately not offered). **Crews wear SVG packs only in v1** — the face is an `<img>` and core ships no Lottie or sprite player, so a pack in either format lists greyed and unselectable rather than hidden. A pack may also carry a per-state sound (`sounds` in its manifest, `.mp3`/`.ogg`/`.wav` under 512 KB, typed by sniffing the bytes), served one state at a time from `GET /api/appearances/{id}/sound/{state}` and travelling in the bundle with the art. That route is a backend contract today: nothing in the dashboard plays a pack's audio yet, and the picker does not author it | `/capabilities?tab=crews` → a crew → Edit avatar → Library | `components/CrewAvatarLibraryTab.tsx`, `components/CrewAvatarBuilder.tsx`, `components/CrewAvatar.tsx` (the pack tier), `lib/appearancePacks/library.ts`, `lib/appearancePacks/types.ts` | `handlers/appearances.py`, `dashboard/appearances.py` (crew store), `appearance_packs/store.py` (shared store class), `appearance_packs/transfer.py` (bundle import and PetDex fetch), `appearance_packs/sounds.py` (cue vocabulary and audio sniffing) | `GET /api/appearances`, `GET /api/appearances/{id}`, `GET /api/appearances/{id}/slot/{slot}`, `GET /api/appearances/{id}/sound/{state}`, `POST /api/appearances/import`, `POST /api/appearances/petdex/fetch`, `DELETE /api/appearances/{id}` |
| Agent Templates | The harness-level agent definitions crews bind to — viewed and edited inline in each agent's Template pane (`components/crew/AgentTemplateDetail.tsx`); the standalone tab was removed | `/capabilities?tab=crews` | `pages/KiroCrewAgentsPage.tsx` | `handlers/agents.py` | `GET /api/agents/installed`, `GET,PATCH /api/agents/detail/{name}`, `POST /api/agents/detail/{name}/fork`, `POST /api/agents/detail/{name}/publish`, `POST /api/agents/detail/{name}/reset` |

| Prompts | Reusable prompt entries from the registry | `?tab=prompts` | `pages/overview/PromptsTab.tsx` | `handlers/prompts.py` | `GET /api/prompts`, `GET /api/prompts/{name}` |
| Steering | Always-injected steering documents | `?tab=steering` | `pages/overview/SteeringTab.tsx` | `handlers/steering.py` | `GET,POST /api/steering`, `PUT,DELETE /api/steering/{key}` |
| Hooks | Event-triggered agent runs | `?tab=hooks` | `pages/HooksPage.tsx` | `handlers/hooks.py` | `GET,POST /api/hooks`, `PUT,DELETE /api/hooks/{hook_id}`, `GET /api/kiro-hooks` |
| Workflows | Saved dynamic-workflow definitions and their runs | `?tab=workflows` | `pages/overview/WorkflowLibraryTab.tsx` | `handlers/workflows.py` | `POST /api/workflows/run`, `GET,POST /api/workflows/definitions`, `POST /api/workflows/author` |

`/agents`, `/mc-agents` and `/connections` are legacy paths that redirect here;
`/knowledge` redirects to `?tab=knowledge`. `/hooks` also stands alone as a
full page.

## Memory, lessons and usage

Not a rail destination. The user-facing memory browser is a drill-in under
Settings → Overview; the graph visualizer is a Developer internals view.

The picker separates Global Memory V1 from each member's private V2. Member
creation allocates its empty memory automatically; the editor shows an immutable
binding and links directly to `/settings/overview?view=memory&store=<name>`. Legacy members
offer explicit empty initialization. The member panel scopes facts, directives,
experiences, recall evidence, preferences, projects, carve, retirement and backups
to its store. Copying selected starting knowledge is an explicit owner action
with provenance and no overwrite. Global settings and embedding controls appear
only on the global surface. Global V1's shared editor also keeps the Key/Value/Set
action for creating facts through `PUT /api/memory/semantic`; the form never
appears on a member's private store. An absent `?store=` continues to serve V1.

Private memory cards show the remembered content; their internal keys are in
Memory details. Selection controls occupy a separate row from Find and replace
and Forget. Legacy schedule rows state that the run uses Global Memory V1.

Private-memory boundary coverage lives in `test/test_member_memory_ownership.py`,
`test/test_member_memory_runtime.py`, `test/test_member_memory_algorithm.py`,
`test/test_member_memory_api.py` and `test/test_member_memory_backup.py`.
Pooled member authority is covered by `test/test_mcp_caller.py`,
`test/test_mcp_gateway_recaller.py` and `test/test_mcp_gateway_backend_coverage.py`:
kernel-bound per-call proof issuance, forged caller removal and concurrent
header isolation.
`website/src/test/MemberMemoryIdentity.test.tsx` covers automatic identity and
scheduled-member binding; `MemberMemoryPanel.test.tsx` covers scoped lifecycle
requests, server search, explicit copy limits and partial outcomes, structured
correction (including stable-identity experiences), full detail expansion from
three-line card previews, retired-memory pagination and live refresh, persisted
recovery staging/cancellation, unavailable-store retry, exact member avatars,
empty-member conversation links, and profile drafts across tab/store/browser
navigation and saves in flight.
`MemoryStorePicker.test.tsx` retains the global-versus-member read assertions.
`MemoryRecordsEditor.test.tsx` covers cross-page selection, stale-preview draft
refresh, proposal acceptance/retention, JSON scalar editing and recall query
changes. `website/playwright/member-memory.spec.ts` exercises the real isolated
gateway: member lifecycle, recovery staging, persisted conversations and both
V1/V2 65-record Email batches with concurrent edits and mobile previews.
It also verifies accepting and rejecting conflict proposals in each lineage.

## Schedules and loops

| Feature | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Schedule | Cron jobs: recurring agent turns, scripts, commands | `/schedule` — rail **Schedule**; also created inline from the crew editor's "What wakes this crew" section (`/capabilities?tab=crews`) | `pages/SchedulePage.tsx`, `components/CrewWakeSection.tsx` | `handlers/cron.py` | `GET,POST /api/crons`, `DELETE /api/crons/{job_id}`, `GET /api/crons/history` |
| Cron secret grants | Owner-approved vault-secret env grants for script crons: agent requests via `cron_secret_request`, the owner approves/denies/revokes on the job's Secrets panel | `/schedule` → job → **Secrets** | `pages/SchedulePage.tsx` (`JobSecretsPanel`) | `handlers/cron.py` | `PUT /api/crons/{job_id}/secrets` |
| Template update signal | A job created from a Schedule template records the template's id and prompt snapshot; the job detail panel shows a dismissible hint (naming the template) when that template's prompt has since changed | `/schedule` → job detail | `pages/SchedulePage.tsx` (`TemplateUpdatedNotice`), `utils/schedulePresets.tsx` (`templateUpdate`) | `handlers/cron.py` | `POST /api/crons` (accepts `source_preset`, `source_template_prompt`), `GET,POST /api/crons` |
| Monitor loops | Same-session bounded monitors and legacy nudge loops watching an external thing; a member's loop is also surfaced read-only in the Crew Members side panel's Crew summary tab | Chat composer → monitor popover; Crew Members → side panel → Crew summary → Auto patrol; agent-armed | `components/SessionAutomationPopover.tsx`, `components/AutoNudgePopover.tsx`, `components/autoNudgeLoop.ts`, `pages/members/MembersPage.tsx` (read-only) | `handlers/autonudge.py` | `GET,POST /api/monitors`, `PATCH /api/monitors/{id}`, `GET /api/monitors/slot/{slot_key}`, `POST /api/monitors/{id}/stop`, `POST /api/monitors/{id}/clear`, `POST /api/monitors/{id}/restart`, `GET,POST /api/autonudge`, `PATCH,DELETE /api/autonudge/{loop_id}`, `POST /api/autonudge/{loop_id}/fire` |
| Session ledger | Durable per-session work state surviving compaction | Agent-written; no dashboard page | — | `handlers/session_ledger.py` | `GET /api/session-ledger`, `POST /api/session-ledger/record` |
| Work ledger | The shared record between a conductor session and the worker sessions it dispatched: a worker reports schema-bounded status against its own item, and its conductor reads that record plus the acceptance batch it decides from. Used by `kirocrew-conductor` (and its deprecated `kirocrew-ledger-conductor` alias, the same spec under the flow's old name for one release) plus `kirocrew-worker` — `kirocrew-pipeline-conductor` and `kirocrew-security-conductor` deliberately do not mount `kirocrew-work`, because their children report through their own skills' scripts | Agent-written via the `kirocrew-work` MCP tools; no dashboard page yet (Phase 4 adds the Crew page item table) | — | `handlers/work_ledger.py` | `GET /api/work-ledger`, `POST /api/work-ledger/record`, `GET /api/work-ledger/brief`, `POST /api/work-ledger/report` |
| Session control | Create / stop / send-to a session from outside it | Agent and app callers, not a UI | — | `session_control.py` | `POST /api/session-control/create`, `.../stop`, `.../send`, `GET .../read` |
| Agent chat egress | Post, edit and delete the bot's own chat messages from an agent turn. For POST and EDIT, a room target must be in the tracked-channel allowlist and a DM must be the owner's resolved DM, and outbound text and blocks pass the display-form redaction floor before reaching the provider. DELETE carries NO target authorization today: it validates only that `channel` and `ts` are present and forwards to the provider, so it reaches any message the bot token can delete (documented gap, not a described boundary) | Agent-written via the `kirocrew-core` messaging MCP tools; no dashboard page | — | `handlers/messaging.py` | `POST /api/send-message`, `POST /api/update-message`, `POST /api/delete-message` |

## Artifacts

| Feature | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Apps

Third-party and builtin apps that add their own pages, crons and MCP tools.

| Feature | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Discover | Browse the app registries and install; an app whose only offering is crew templates (`crew.templates`, no UI / crons / skills / MCP servers) files under the **Templates** category regardless of its tags | `/apps` — **Apps** section header link; category rail → **Templates** | `pages/apps/DiscoverPage.tsx`, `components/appstore/categories.ts` (`categoryFor(tags, manifest)`, `crewTemplatesOf`) | `src/kiro_crew/apps/routes.py`, `apps/registry.py` (`manifest.crew` forwarded) | `GET /api/apps/registry`, `POST /api/apps/registry/install`, `GET /api/apps/registries` |
| Updates | Apps with a newer version available | `/apps/-/updates` | `pages/apps/DiscoverPage.tsx`, `pages/apps/UpdatesList.tsx` | `src/kiro_crew/apps/routes.py` | `GET /api/apps`, `POST /api/apps/{name}/update` |
| Library | Installed apps as launchpad tiles, with rail pinning. Lists enabled apps by default; a labelled toggle ("Show N disabled") reveals the disabled ones too, and the choice is remembered per browser in `localStorage` (not synced across devices or origins) | `/apps/library` | `pages/apps/LibraryPage.tsx` | `src/kiro_crew/apps/routes.py` | `GET /api/apps`, `POST /api/apps/{name}/enable`, `POST /api/apps/{name}/disable` |
| App detail | One app's manifest, config, permissions, uninstall | `/apps/detail/:name` | `pages/AppDetailPage.tsx` | `src/kiro_crew/apps/routes.py` | `GET /api/apps/{name}`, `GET /api/apps/{name}/manifest`, `GET /api/apps/{name}/config` |
| Installed app page | An app's own UI, served by the app | `/apps/:name` | `pages/AppPage.tsx` | app-owned | `POST /api/apps/{name}/token`, `POST /api/apps/{name}/open` |
| App migration | Move an app's data after a packaging change | `/apps/migrate/:name` | `pages/MigrationPage.tsx` | `src/kiro_crew/apps/routes.py` | `DELETE /api/apps/{name}/migrate-cleanup` |
| Builtin app surfaces | Top-level routes builtin apps claim | `/<app>` via the `/:builtinApp` catch-all | `apps/builtinRegistry.ts` → per-app page | per-app `backend/routes.py` | `POST /api/apps/<app>/...` per app |
| App session controls | A compact per-chat control an app contributes to the composer, handed the active session's identity | Chip in the composer bar of any chat, when an enabled app declares `contributes.sessionControls` — no route of its own | `hooks/useSessionControls.ts`, `components/SessionControlHost.tsx`, `components/ChatInput.tsx` (chips), `pages/ChatPage.tsx` (wiring) | `src/kiro_crew/apps/manifest.py` (declaration + validation); the status route is app-owned | `GET /api/apps`, `GET /api/apps/{name}/{statusPath}` (in-gateway) or `GET /apps/{name}/api/{statusPath}` (process-backed) |

`apps/builtinRegistry.ts` is the path→component table for builtin surfaces
(22 entries: Worlds, Channels, Auto Improvement, Auto Research, AWS Control,
File Explorer, Code Review Sage, Workflows, Dev Fleet, Issue Radar, Meetings,
Papyrus, PPTX Maker, Ops Mission Control, Design Critique, Crew Companion,
Task Runner, MD Notebook, Mochi, Spec Builder, Personal Shopper, Design Tweak).
Adding a builtin surface means an entry there plus `ui.pages` in the manifest —
`App.tsx` needs no change, which is why the router-delta half of the freshness
check cannot see it and the pages-dir half can.

## Task runner and subagents

| Feature | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Task Runner | Autonomous multi-step runs from a spec | `/projects` — **Apps** group rail row | `pages/ProjectsPage.tsx` | `handlers/taskrunner.py`, `handlers_project.py` | `GET,POST /api/projects`, `POST /api/taskrunner/plan`, `POST /api/taskrunner/from-chat` |

| Worktrees | Create a git worktree for a follow-up session | Chat follow-up card → new worktree | `pages/ChatPage.tsx` | `handlers/worktree.py` | `POST /api/worktree/create` |

## Settings

`/settings/*` is a splat route; `pages/SettingsPage.tsx` parses the trailing
segments itself (`segment[0]` = tab, `segment[1]` = sub-nav). Every row below
is `/settings/<key>`. Panels live in `pages/settings/`.

| Tab | What it is | Panel | Handler | Endpoints |

| `instances` | Remote Kiro Crew instances to connect to, and the provisioning lanes that create them (built-in EC2 plus edition lanes from the `remote_provisioners` CPP seam) | `RemoteCrewPanel.tsx`, `InstancesPanel.tsx`, `components/remoteProvisionerRenderers.tsx` | `handlers_instances.py`, `handlers_cloud.py` | `GET,POST /api/instances`, `POST /api/instances/{id}/connect`, `GET /api/cloud/provisioners`, `GET /api/cloud/preflight` |

| — (cross-cutting) | Host-side backup of the browser-held settings the tabs above write, so they survive a moved dashboard port or a relocated Electron `userData`. Restores on a profile that has never reached the host; allowlist-scoped (`DURABLE_PREF_KEYS`), not every browser key | — (no panel; `lib/uiPrefs.ts` is the client) | `handlers/ui_prefs.py` | `GET,PUT /api/ui-prefs` |

Flagged-file delivery consent (`GET,POST,DELETE /api/file-delivery/consent`,
owner-gated) is listed on the `security` row because that is the tab it belongs
to, but **no panel is wired to it yet** -- the endpoints are the only way to
record or withdraw the grant today (#8793). Stated rather than implied: the
backend control landed first so the delivery gates could read it, and the panel
is a follow-up. Nothing about the grant is reachable from an agent either way;
the record sits on the sandbox-sealed keystone floor.

Instances is deliberately not a rail row: it is set up here once and switched
from the header tab strip. Webhooks carries both a preview flag and
`hiddenFromNav`, so it surfaces as this Settings tab rather than a rail row.

The UI-preference backup row carries no tab because it has no panel and nothing
for a user to reach: it is the mechanism behind the tabs above, listed so its
handler has an owner in this map. Its allowlist is explicit, so a preference
absent from `DURABLE_PREF_KEYS` is still lost on an origin change, and a value
that gates a safety confirmation (`mc-yolo-ack`) is deliberately excluded. The
contract is in
[../system-specs/modules/config.md](../system-specs/modules/config.md).

## Developer

`/developer` (`pages/DeveloperPage.tsx`), ten `?tab=` values. Internals views;
not where a user manages their own data. The former `feature-previews` tab moved
to Settings > Developer (`pages/settings/FeaturePreviewsSection.tsx`); the old
`?tab=feature-previews` link redirects there.

| Tab | What it is | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `logs` | Live gateway log stream and level control | `pages/LogsPage.tsx` (`LogViewer`) | `handlers/updates.py` | `GET /api/logs`, `GET,POST /api/logs/level` |
| `system` | Host runtime, services, sessions, performance | `pages/SystemPage.tsx`, `pages/system/` | `handlers_system.py`, `handlers/session_storage.py` | `GET /api/system`, `GET /api/system/session-storage` |
| `telemetry` | Startup timings and context traces | `pages/TelemetryPanel.tsx` | `handlers/telemetry.py` | `GET /api/telemetry/startup`, `GET /api/telemetry/context-trace` |
| `storage` | Raw localStorage inspector | `pages/LocalStorageDebug.tsx` | — (client only) | — |
| `mcp-pool` | MCP connection pool state | `pages/settings/McpManagement.tsx` | `handlers/mcp.py` | `GET /api/mcp/active`, `GET /api/mcp/scopes`, `POST /api/mcp/probe` |
| `memory` | Memory graph visualizer | `pages/overview/MemoryGraphTab.tsx` | `handlers/memory.py` | `GET /api/memory/graph` |
| `config` | Raw Kiro Crew and agent config editors | `pages/overview/KiroCrewCfgTab.tsx`, `AgentCfgTab.tsx` | `handlers/core.py`, `handlers/agents.py` | `GET,PUT,PATCH /api/config/kirocrew`, `GET,PUT /api/agent/config` |
| `agent-backend` | Which agent harness backend is live; hosts the **Kiro sign-in** card (see Standalone operator surfaces) while KAS is an offered backend | `pages/developer/AgentBackendTab.tsx`, `pages/developer/KiroSignInCard.tsx` | `handlers/acp_backend_status.py`, `handlers/kiro_prerequisite.py` | `GET /api/acp-backends`, `GET /api/kiro-prerequisite` |
| `debug-tools` | Diagnostic overlays, currently the chat scroll inspector | `pages/developer/DebugToolsTab.tsx` | — (client only) | — |
| `archive` | Consolidated session archive browser | `pages/SessionArchive.tsx` | `handlers/sessions.py` | `GET /api/session/archive`, `GET /api/session/archive/{name}` |

## Standalone operator surfaces

| Feature | What it is | Reach it | Page | Handler | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Logs | Full-page log viewer | `/logs` | `pages/LogsPage.tsx` | `handlers/updates.py` | `GET /api/logs`, `GET /api/stream` |
| Hooks | Full-page hook manager | `/hooks` | `pages/HooksPage.tsx` | `handlers/hooks.py` | `GET,POST /api/hooks`, `GET /api/kiro-hooks` |
| Webhooks | Inbound webhook tokens, contexts, run history | `/webhooks` (preview-gated) | `pages/WebhooksPage.tsx` | `handlers/hooks.py` | `GET /api/webhooks`, `POST /api/webhooks/tokens`, `POST /api/hooks/agent` |
| Cloud launch | Provision a remote Kiro Crew instance through a provisioner lane: the built-in lane creates an EC2 instance in the user's own AWS account; an edition may add lanes via the `remote_provisioners` CPP seam, and the tab shows a lane selector only when more than one drawable lane exists (`registerRemoteProvisionerRenderer`) | Settings → Remote Instances → Set up a new one | `pages/settings/RemoteCrewPanel.tsx`, `components/remoteProvisionerRenderers.tsx` | `handlers_cloud.py`, `platform/defaults.py` (`DefaultRemoteProvisionerProvider`) | `GET /api/cloud/provisioners`, `GET /api/cloud/preflight`, `POST /api/cloud/launch` (`provider_id`), `GET /api/cloud/iam-policy` |
| Mobile connect | Pair a phone to this gateway | Left rail → **Connect your phone** (governed methods + QR); Settings → Security → mobile card (sign-in link only) | `App.tsx`, `components/MobileConnectModal.tsx`, `pages/settings/MobileLoginCard.tsx` | `handlers/mobile_connect.py`, `handlers/auth_mobile.py`, `handlers/tailnet_mobile.py` | `GET /api/mobile-connect/methods`, `POST /api/auth/mobile-link`, `POST /api/tailnet/mobile/qr` |
| Kiro sign-in | Sign in to the Kiro identity agents run as under the KAS backend, without a kiro-cli login: Google/GitHub via loopback (local) or device code (remote), Builder ID and company SSO via device code; signed-in summary with sign-out; explicit "sign-in expired" state (no silent fallback to kiro-cli login) | Developer → Agent Backend → **Kiro sign-in** card, under the backend switch and only while KAS is an offered backend (Developer Mode preview, so deliberately not on Settings → Overview and not in Settings search; Overview shows only a one-line **Kiro sign-in moved to Developer > Agent Backend** signpost while KAS is the selected backend); chat error row "not signed in" → **Sign in to Kiro** deep link (`/developer?tab=agent-backend&highlight=key:kiro-sign-in`, which rings the card). The full-screen `KasLoginGate` form is still not mounted at the app root | `pages/developer/KiroSignInCard.tsx`, `pages/developer/kiroSignInLink.ts`, `pages/developer/AgentBackendTab.tsx`, `pages/OverviewPage.tsx` (`KiroSignInMovedPointer`), `components/KasLoginGate.tsx`, `pages/chat/ErrorCard.tsx` | `handlers/kas_login.py`, `auth/service.py` (`status()`), `auth/refresh.py` (`RefreshRejected`) | `GET /api/kas-login`, `POST /api/kas-login/device`, `POST /api/kas-login/loopback`, `POST /api/kas-login/poll`, `POST /api/kas-login/cancel`, `POST /api/kas-login/logout` |
| Source-provider review | PR state, checks and review threads in the Changes panel | Chat right panel → **Changes** | `components/PullRequestPanel.tsx`, `components/CommentThreads.tsx` | `handlers/source_providers.py` | `POST /api/source/pull-request`, `.../checks`, `.../status`, `.../resolve` |
| Crash report notice | Desktop-only banner on the launch after a crash: a count of new own-app crash artifacts, **Show diagnostics** (reveals the crash ledger in the OS file manager) and dismiss | Appears automatically on the next launch after a desktop crash — no navigation | `components/CrashReportNotice.tsx` (mounted app-wide in `App.tsx`) | `website/electron/crash-collector.js`, `website/electron/ipc-registrar.js`, `website/electron/preload.js` (`crashReportsAPI`) | IPC, not HTTP: `crash-reports:get`, `crash-reports:reveal` |
| Startup feature video | One short clip introducing a new feature, shown once on the launch after it ships and retired permanently by a `seen` or `dismissed` verdict; yields the whole launch to release notes, an update popup or first-run onboarding, and is skipped in incognito/temporary sessions. A clip is always played from disk -- the release folder for a downloaded one, the shipped assets for a built-in one -- and never streamed from the CDN: the browser only plays bytes the gateway downloaded and sha256-checked first, so an uncached hosted clip waits for the next launch. Every offer's files were proved on disk by the request that offered it, so the dialog opens on the `/next` answer alone | Appears by itself at startup, with no navigation, on the first launch where nothing else claimed the screen and the catalog still has an entry this install has not used | `components/StartupVideoModal.tsx`, `components/startupVideoGate.ts` (sequencing policy), mounted app-wide in `App.tsx` | `feature_videos.py`, `feature_videos_manifest.py` (signed hosted catalog), `feature_videos_cache.py` (local clip cache + serving) | `GET /api/feature-videos/next`, `POST /api/feature-videos/feedback`, `GET /feature-videos/<release>/<file>` |
| Feature-video cache readout | How much of the current release's clips is on disk, which one is downloading, and one control to fetch them all now. Read-only apart from that control; the control is absent when policy forbids downloads, and the whole row is absent on a gateway whose `status` predates the cache fields | `/settings?tab=chat`, in the Messages card beside Feature Tips | `pages/settings/ChatPanel.tsx` | `feature_videos.py`, `feature_videos_cache.py` | `GET /api/feature-videos/status`, `POST /api/feature-videos/fetch-all` |
| OpenAI-compatible API | Chat-completions shim for external clients | External clients only | — | `openai_compat.py` | `POST /v1/chat/completions` |

## Popouts and embeds

Separate top-level route trees `App.tsx` selects before the dashboard chrome
renders, so nothing in them carries the sidebar.

| Route | What it is | Page |
|---|---|---|
| `/popout/chat/:slug?` | One session in its own OS window | `pages/PopoutFrame.tsx` |
| `/popout/artifact/:slug` | One artifact in its own window | `pages/ArtifactPopoutFrame.tsx` |
| `/popout/terminal` | The docked terminal, detached | `pages/TerminalPopoutFrame.tsx` |
| `/embed/chat/:slug?` | Chat embedded in a host surface | `pages/ChatPage.tsx` (`embedded`) |
| `/embed/sessions` | Session list embedded in a host surface | `pages/ChatPage.tsx` (`embedded`) |
| `/embed/settings` | Reduced settings for an embedded host | `pages/EmbedSettingsPage.tsx` |

## Redirects

Kept so old bookmarks and deep links still resolve. Adding a feature never
means adding a row here; retiring one usually does.

| From | To |
|---|---|
| `/knowledge` | `/capabilities?tab=knowledge` |
| `/agents`, `/mc-agents` | `/capabilities` |
| `/connections` | `/capabilities?tab=mcp` |
| `/overview` | `/settings/overview` |
| `/instances` | `/settings/instances` |
| `/artifacts/deploy` | `/deploy` |
| `/orchestrated/:slug?` | `/chat/:slug?` (orchestrator slot) |
| `/tasks` | Task Runner |
| anything unmatched | `/chat` |
