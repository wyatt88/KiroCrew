# Harness parity: Kiro first, everything else adapted

A *harness* is the agent process Kiro Crew drives over ACP. Kiro Crew has one
first-class harness — `kiro-cli` (`ACP_BACKEND_KIRO`, spelled `""`) — and a
growing set of adapted ones: Claude Code (`ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE`), `KAS`
(`ACP_BACKEND_KAS`), Codex (`ACP_BACKEND_CODEX`), and whatever a
bring-your-own (BYO) adapter registers next.

Kiro, Claude Code, KAS and Codex are selectable on a plain public build; Claude Code in
particular is a shipped harness and not a dormant seam: `acp/client.py` owns the
whole Claude spawn path and the adapter is a public npm package, so an earlier
revision that left it out of the baseline removed only the switch, never a
capability. Whether the binaries are INSTALLED on a given machine is a different
question, answered by `agent_sdk/backend_install.py`'s probe rather than by
selectability.

`BASELINE_SELECTABLE_BACKENDS` is otherwise `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`, so an id this
core can spell is an id an operator can choose unless something states the
exception — pinned by
`test_agent_backend_editable.py::test_baseline_ships_every_known_backend`, which
guards against an undocumented NARROWING rather than a widening.
There is no exception today: `NOT_SHIPPED_SELECTABLE` is empty, which is the
healthy state. `ACP_BACKEND_CODEX` was the last member and left it once both
halves landed — `backend_install.py` gained its probe, so the install row names
the missing component and its command instead of reading `unknown`, and
`acp_tool_gate` established that its tool calls reach the PreToolUse gate.

Read the invariants below against that tree: four harnesses can serve a real
session today, so a site that spells "kiro" by exclusion is already wrong on
three of them.

*Parity* here does not mean equal treatment. It means the opposite, stated
precisely: **an added harness may only adapt itself to the seams the Kiro
harness already runs through. It may not move, widen, generalize, or add a
branch to those seams.** A harness that cannot be adapted without changing the
Kiro path is not ready to land.

The failure mode this file exists to prevent is not a broken adapter — that
fails loudly on its own first session. It is the *silent capture* of the Kiro
path: a call site that spells "kiro" as `not is_<other>_backend`, so harness
number three inherits a capability, a sandbox waiver, or a session label that
nobody granted it, and the Kiro user who never chose another harness pays for it.
Two such sites shipped before this file existed
(`AcpProvider.is_session_sharing_eligible`, `AcpRuntime.spawn`'s
`is_kiro_cli`); both read as correct until you count the backends.

The transports these invariants constrain are specified in
[acp-client.md](acp-client.md) (framing, timeouts, the backend seam) and
[providers.md](providers.md) (the `LLMProvider` surface). The edition-level
registration seam is in
[platform-context.md](platform-context.md). This file only catalogs the
invariants and names what pins each one.

## How to read a row

- **Guarantees** is the property that goes RED when broken, not the
  implementation that happens to satisfy it today.
- **Pinned by** names the test module and function. Test modules live at `test/`
  in the repo root; sources live at `src/kiro_crew/`. A row marked
  *review-only* has no deterministic test — it is enforced by the
  `harness-parity` rule in `AUTOSDE.yaml`, which every AI review lane reads.
- An invariant is *closed* by its test, not by this document. If a row
  disagrees with the named test, the test is right.
- The ids are stable. Source docstrings and review findings cite them bare
  (`H4`, `H6`), so the id is the lookup key.

## Group A: Kiro is the default and the floor

These break by *addition*: a harness lands, nothing at these sites is edited,
and Kiro stops being the guaranteed path.

| Id | Guarantees | Pinned by | Constrains |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | `agent.acp_backend` defaults to `ACP_BACKEND_KIRO`, and `ACP_BACKEND_KIRO` is in `selectable_backends()` unconditionally. An operator who configures nothing, and an operator whose configuration is unusable, both get the Kiro harness. | `test_harness_parity.py::test_kiro_is_the_default_backend`, `::test_kiro_is_always_selectable` | `config/loader.py` (`AgentConfig.acp_backend`), `acp_backends.py` (`BASELINE_SELECTABLE_BACKENDS`) |
| H2 | A harness is chosen at `agent.acp_backend`. `agent.provider` stays `enum=["acp"]`: there is one provider and it is never the harness selector, because a second provider value would route around every invariant below. | `test_harness_parity.py::test_provider_enum_is_acp_only` | `config/loader.py` (`AgentConfig.provider`, `build_provider_factory`) |
| H3 | An unknown or unselectable persisted backend degrades to Kiro with a logged reason. It never raises and never survives — including the non-string shapes a hand-edited `config.json` can hold. Startup refusing with a reason is the contract; a stack trace or a silent foreign spawn is not. There is exactly ONE gate, and it reads `selectable_backends()` per call, so registering a backend is what makes a persisted value survive; the Kiro construction path gains no second check (H13). It must never read the platform context — `current_context()`'s lazy branch loads config and would re-enter the same load. | `test_harness_parity.py::test_unselectable_backend_degrades_to_kiro`, `::test_registering_a_backend_makes_it_survive_load`, `::test_config_load_never_reads_the_platform_context` | `acp_backends.py` (`resolve_selected_backend`), `config/loader.py` (`_normalize_acp_backend`) |
| H4 | Selectability has exactly ONE gate, and it logs. `AgentConfig.acp_backend` carries no static `enum`: a literal was frozen at import, before an edition registers a backend, and `validate_config_data` *deletes* an out-of-enum value before the loader sees it — so a registered preview harness was stripped from `config.json` with no degrade log at all. `resolve_selected_backend` is the gate; `GET /api/config/schema` supplies the live values the dashboard renders. | `test_harness_parity.py::test_selectability_has_one_logged_gate` | `config/loader.py` (`AgentConfig.acp_backend` metadata), `config/validation.py` (`validate_config_data`), `dashboard/handlers/agents.py` (`_supply_live_enum`) |

## Group B: identity is tested positively

The whole group is one rule with several faces: **no call site may express
"this is the Kiro harness" as the absence of another harness.** A negative test
is correct only while one harness can start, and it fails *open* — the other
harness is treated as Kiro. Four are selectable today, so `not
is_claude_backend` is not a rule waiting on a future harness to break it: it
already reads TRUE for KAS on a plain public build.

| Id | Guarantees | Pinned by | Constrains |
|---|---|---|---|
| H5 | Harness identity is a positive comparison against a named constant, or membership in a named set. `not is_claude_backend`, `!= ACP_BACKEND_KAS`, and `== "kas"` (bare literal) are all forbidden; `is_kiro_backend` and `backend in ACP_BACKENDS_<CAP>` are the forms. Enforced on the lines a change ADDS, not whole-tree — see the gate doc for why. | `scripts/check_harness_parity.py` (six rules, self-tested), `test_harness_parity.py::test_added_line_gate_self_test_passes`, `::test_added_line_gate_flags_a_planted_negative_test` | every module reading `AcpClient.backend` / `AcpProvider.is_*_backend` |
| H6 | A capability is granted by opt-in membership, never by negation. `is_session_sharing_eligible` reads `ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_SHARING` and `supports_steer` reads `ACP_BACKENDS_STEER`, so a harness that has not demonstrated the capability does not inherit it from a set it was never added to. **Both drivers answer from the table, not one of them:** `AcpSessionHandle.supports_steer` reads it through the runtime's own backend id, because a constant that was true while `AcpRuntime` served a single host becomes a claim about the second host the moment one is added — and an advertised steer is met with `-32601` at the user's mid-turn correction. `store_session_config` is the same case for a model list: a host whose models arrive as a `model` select in `configOptions` rather than as a `models` object has them folded in by `session_models_envelope`, gated on `ACP_BACKENDS_ADVERTISED_MODEL_SELECTION` and read by BOTH the session-init capture and the entitlement probe, or its picker is empty on the runtime path while full on the client one and the probe cannot heal a degraded snapshot. **A COMPLETENESS gate backs all of these, because the per-site pins above only catch the sites that exist.** Two halves in `test_harness_parity.py`: every runtime-path per-host answer is asserted equal to its table for every backend in `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN` — not only for the hosts the site was written against, so a divergence is caught before a third host is admitted — and every backend-identity comparison in `acp/runtime.py` and `acp/session_handle.py` must appear in `_DECLARED_IDENTITY_TESTS` with a reason, so a NEW site answering from identity goes red until its author either points it at the table that already answers it or records why identity is honest there. The declaration list is pruned by its own test, so it cannot rot into a blanket pre-approval. One gate run answers for every site and every known host at once, which is what a per-site pin cannot do. Every *tuning channel* follows the same rule, one set per channel because a harness can implement one and not another: `ACP_BACKENDS_MODEL_VIA_CONFIG_OPTION` (model switch), `ACP_BACKENDS_EFFORT_VIA_CONFIG_OPTION` (effort push), `ACP_BACKENDS_MODEL_EFFORT_PAIR_IDS` (whether an advertised `<model>[<effort>]` id is applied as two config-option writes -- and, with it, whether a refusal of an advertised id reads as an adapter mismatch rather than an entitlement verdict), and `ACP_BACKENDS_KIRO_SLASH_COMMANDS` — membership in the last also decides who is sent `_kiro.dev/commands/execute` and who gets the workspace `cli.json` overlay written for them. A harness in none of these must not inherit a channel that answers `-32601`, nor collect an overlay it never reads and the membership-gated clear can never remove. `ACP_BACKENDS_MCP_CONFIG_HOT_RELOAD` follows the same rule for a *skip*: membership is what lets the dashboard's MCP sync leave running sessions alone after a config write, because the harness reconciles the agent file itself (kiro-cli, from the release its reconcile was verified on; `mcp_hot_reload.py` holds every live process to that floor, read from its own `initialize` handshake). A harness that never demonstrated the reconcile would otherwise have its users' freshly installed servers stay unmounted with nothing red to say why. `ACP_BACKENDS_POD_HOME_REMAP` is a further instance and the clearest illustration of why one set per capability matters: it decides whose pod-spawned child has its ambient `HOME` relocated so the harness's `$HOME`-derived OAuth grant store stays pod-scoped (`acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap`). Its membership is identical to `ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX` today, and reusing that set would still be wrong — "carries its own OS sandbox" and "relocating `HOME` moves its credential store" are different properties, so a harness added there for sandbox reasons would silently inherit credential relocation it never opted into. A channel's option ID is a per-harness spelling rather than a membership question, so it is resolved through `effort_config_option_id(backend)` (default `effort`, `reasoning_effort` for codex-acp) and read at every effort site; a site naming one spelling writes an option the other adapter answers "unknown config option" to, which each caller reads as "no effort selector" and skips, so the failure is silent and the session runs a level the UI does not report. `ACP_BACKENDS_SIDE_READONLY` gates whether a Side Chat turn may execute read-only tools under `READ_ONLY` at all: the allowance rests on the derived `<agent>--readonly` kiro-cli spec, and another harness's own pre-approval surface is one the host gate cannot see, so off the set the side turn runs `REJECT_ALL` (see `side.md`). | `test_harness_parity.py::test_session_sharing_is_opt_in`, `::test_steer_is_opt_in`, `::test_model_switch_channel_is_opt_in`, `::test_effort_channel_is_opt_in`, `::test_only_overlay_readers_are_written_to`, `::test_mcp_config_hot_reload_is_opt_in`, `test_acp_pod_home_remap.py::TestTheCapabilitySetIsItsOwnDecision`, `test_acp_codex_harness.py::TestTheEffortChannelIsReadFromItsOwnTable`, `::TestWhatTheHandleAdvertisesForCodex`, `test_harness_parity.py::test_steer_advertisement_matches_the_steer_table`, `::test_agent_activation_by_mode_matches_the_routing_table`, `::test_the_model_select_fold_matches_the_advertised_selection_table`, `::test_unprojected_pooled_mcp_is_refused_for_exactly_the_mirrored_hosts`, `::test_every_runtime_path_identity_test_is_declared`, `::test_the_identity_test_declarations_are_all_still_live` | `providers/acp.py` (`AcpProvider.is_session_sharing_eligible`, `change_effort`, `clear_effort`, `_apply_initial_effort`, `_apply_effort_overlay`, `_apply_tool_search_overlay`, `stream_command`), `acp/client.py` (`AcpClient.supports_steer`, `_apply_pod_home_remap`), `acp/session_handle.py` (`AcpSessionHandle.supports_steer`, `store_session_config`, `models_from_config_options`), `acp_backends.py`, `mcp_hot_reload.py` (`mcp_hot_reload_supported`) |
| H7 | `is_kiro_cli` is a positive Kiro test at every call site. It drives internal-sandbox delegation: macOS skips Kiro Crew's seatbelt because Kiro's sandbox cannot nest inside it, and Windows permits the official Kiro backend to run despite having no Kiro Crew OS wrapper. Passed for a harness with no internal sandbox, it hands isolation to a layer that never starts; this is the only Group B row that is also a security invariant. **Windows requires `is_kiro_cli is True` exactly** — `None` and `_spawns_kiro_cli` basename inference can never grant the backend-less-host exception. On macOS a site may grant membership explicitly or pass `None` to defer to the positive basename test. | `test_harness_parity.py::test_is_kiro_cli_is_positive`, `test_sandbox_argv.py::TestKiroInternalSandboxExclusion` | `acp/runtime.py` (`AcpRuntime.spawn`), `acp/client.py` (`AcpClient.ensure_ready`), `sandbox.py` (`wrap_argv`, `_spawns_kiro_cli`) |
| H8 | New harness identifiers live in `agent_sdk/backends.py` — a LEAF module behind the agent-SDK boundary, so every consumer can name the constants rather than copy them — and are added to `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`; every capability set is a subset of it; and `AcpProvider.__init__` rejects anything outside it. `ACP_BACKEND_KIRO` is the empty string, so a value that falls through every identity check spawns `kiro-cli` under a foreign label. `acp/types.py` and the `acp_backends` shim both re-export the vocabulary and remain import sites for existing callers. | `test_harness_parity.py::test_capability_sets_are_subsets_of_known_backends`, `::test_unknown_backend_rejected_at_construction`, `::test_codex_is_selectable_and_answerable` | `agent_sdk/backends.py` (`ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`), `providers/acp.py` (`AcpProvider.__init__`), `scripts/check_harness_parity.py` (`VOCABULARY_PATH`) |

`ACP_BACKENDS_MEMBER_CAPABILITIES` is the H6 opt-in for loading an enrolled
member's full saved agent spec. Only Kiro belongs today; this is separate from
session sharing and per-session member dispatch. Both `AcpProvider` and
`AcpSessionProvider` answer `member_capabilities_supported` from this set.
Support alone does not prove a template is loaded: dedicated runtime ownership,
liveness, active-mode confirmation, saved-version checks and MCP readiness still
apply. Pinned by `test_harness_parity.py::test_member_capabilities_are_opt_in`
and `test_session_capabilities.py::test_real_session_provider_member_support_is_explicit`.

## Group C: the Kiro path keeps its own machinery

An adapter that lands by *generalizing* a Kiro-specific step to a
lowest-common-denominator one has degraded the Kiro session even when every
test still passes.

| Id | Guarantees | Pinned by | Constrains |
|---|---|---|---|
| H9 | `kiro-cli` remains the default branch of spawn-argv resolution, keeping its pre-spawn agent materialization (`kiro-cli` discovers selectable modes from `~/.kiro/agents/*.json` at startup, so a later `set_mode` fails with "Mode not found" without it) and its `--model` pin (the only way to run a model outside the agent's provider). A refactor that treats Kiro as one entry among N drops both. The Kiro spawn lives in its own harness, so no other host shares the code that carries them. | `test_harness_parity.py::test_kiro_spawn_argv_keeps_its_own_branch`, `::test_codex_spawn_keeps_its_own_branch`, `test_acp_harness_contract.py::test_kiro_spawn_argv_names_the_agent_and_the_model` | `acp/harness/kiro.py` (`KiroHarness.resolve_spawn`) |
| H10 | Protocol version and client capabilities stay per-harness literals. Collapsing them to one handshake that every harness accepts silently downgrades the Kiro session's declared capabilities. The hosts also disagree on the protocol version's TYPE, so one shared handshake would break a host outright. | `test_harness_parity.py::test_handshake_is_per_backend`, `test_acp_harness_contract.py::test_protocol_versions_differ_in_type_not_just_value` | `acp/harness/kiro.py`, `acp/harness/kas.py` (`client_capabilities`, `protocol_version`), `acp/types.py` (`ACP_CLIENT_CAPABILITIES`, `KAS_CLIENT_CAPABILITIES`) |
| H11 | The provider label is a closed mapping and an absent label means Kiro. It indexes resume compatibility, session-map persistence, and session-file cleanup routing, so a harness with no `PROVIDER_LABEL_*` of its own persists as a Kiro session and its transcript is pruned for want of a Kiro session file. | `test_harness_parity.py::test_every_known_backend_has_a_label`, `::test_codex_carries_its_own_provider_label` | `acp/types.py` (`PROVIDER_LABEL_*`), `providers/acp.py` (`provider_label`, `cleanup_session`), `session.py` (`detect_provider_switch`) |
| H12 | Model pre-flight keeps "empty or unknown advertised set means allow", and never compares ids across harness namespaces. Harnesses advertise ids in their own spelling; one shared membership test across two namespaces calls every legitimate model unusable and withholds the model. | `test_harness_parity.py::test_model_preflight_allows_unknown_advertised_set` | `acp/client.py` (`model_is_unusable`, `advertised_model_ids`) |

## Group D: review-only invariants

Deterministically un-pinnable — they are properties of a change, not of a tree,
and the absence of a mechanism is not something a source scan can see. The
`harness-parity` rule in `AUTOSDE.yaml` carries them to every AI review lane.

| Id | Guarantees | Pinned by | Constrains |
|---|---|---|---|
| H13 | Harness support is additive at the `ProviderRegistry` seam: a v1 addition, no `CONTRACT_VERSION` bump. The Kiro construction path gains no conditional, no new required argument, and no new failure mode in service of an adapter. The shared-process runtime asks its host's harness per request rather than testing an identity, and Kiro's lookup into that table is TOTAL -- the id is a key of a literal beside the class it names, and the class takes no constructor argument -- so no ordinary session gains a way to fail before its process exists. | review-only (`AUTOSDE.yaml` → `harness-parity`), plus `test_acp_harness_contract.py::test_the_kiro_lookup_is_total`, `::test_the_runtime_resolves_the_kiro_harness_without_spawning` | `platform/interfaces.py` (`ProviderRegistry`), `config/loader.py` (`create_provider_factory`), `acp/harness/__init__.py` (`harness_for`) |
| H14 | A capability the session layer reads off a provider is declared on `LLMProvider` with a safe default. An adapter never forces a `hasattr` / `getattr` probe onto the Kiro path, and never leaves a Kiro-only attribute reachable through the ABC where a missing one reads as `False`. | review-only (`AUTOSDE.yaml` → `harness-parity`) | `providers/base.py` (`LLMProvider`), `providers/acp.py` (`AcpProvider`) |

## The CI half

The added-line gate that enforces Group B on a diff is
[../../ci/harness-parity-gate.md](../../ci/harness-parity-gate.md). The
structural invariants (Groups A and C) are pinned by
`test/test_harness_parity.py` and therefore fail in the ordinary test job, not
in a separate gate. Group D reaches the four AI review lanes through
`AUTOSDE.yaml`'s `harness-parity` rule, which every lane's prompt treats as the
source of truth for what blocks.

## Adding or changing an invariant

1. Write the test first: an invariant is its test, and this table is the index.
   A row whose *Pinned by* cell names nothing is a wish.
2. Cite the id in the source docstring it constrains, and add the row here in
   the same change.
3. Never relax a check to make a red invariant green. A parity failure that
   flips GREEN because the Kiro path was made to match the adapter is the
   regression this file exists to catch, not a fix. If a harness genuinely
   cannot be adapted within these invariants, the correct outcome is that the
   harness does not land yet — say so in the PR instead of widening a seam.
4. A new harness adds rows to `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`, a `PROVIDER_LABEL_*`, and
   an explicit decision for every Group B membership set. "Inherited the
   default" is not a decision. `BASELINE_SELECTABLE_BACKENDS` is otherwise
   `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`, so leaving a known id out of the baseline is a
   NARROWING that `test_baseline_ships_every_known_backend` fails on **unless**
   the id is named in that test's `NOT_SHIPPED_SELECTABLE` allowlist together
   with the reason it cannot be offered yet: the id becomes spellable but
   unreachable, and that state needs a stated reason rather than a default.
   The allowlist is empty today. The full sequence a new
   harness walks, and which stage decides whether it lands dormant or
   selectable, is [harness-onboarding.md](harness-onboarding.md).
