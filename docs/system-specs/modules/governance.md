# Governance Model (two-level Policy ∩ Profile)

The `kiro_crew.platform.governance` + `kiro_crew.platform.governance_profiles`
modules implement KiroCrew's **two-level security governance model**. Governance
is resolved by a single rule — *the tightest boundary wins*:

- **Level 1 — POLICY** (`GovernanceCeiling`): the enterprise security ceiling,
  loaded once at boot from a trust-root path the agent process does not own.
  Once present, the running app **and its agent cannot weaken it**.
- **Level 2 — PROFILE** (`Profile`): a per-surface / per-app / per-task scope
  that may only *narrow* what policy permits.

The effective permission for any item is `policy ∩ profile`. This spec is the
implementation companion to the design doc (Pippin `kirocrew/MVTDhLpm2SSW`).

> Scope: this governs **KiroCrew's own** security boundaries — what the host
> performs on behalf of the agent across every surface (CLI, dashboard, Slack,
> cron, heartbeat, sub-agents, apps). The underlying kiro-cli agent config
> (`~/.kiro/agents/*.json`) is **out of scope**: KiroCrew enforces its own
> ceiling at its own gate even when the kiro side grants more.

## The four archetypes (one composition algebra each)

Every governed control is exactly one of four shapes. The evaluator dispatches
on archetype, never on a scope *name* — this is what keeps the model decoupled
and extensible (adding a scope is data, not engine code).

| Archetype | Shape | Composition (policy ∘ profile) |
|---|---|---|
| `ScopedRuleset` | `{mode, allow[], deny[]}` | Rule 1 within a level (allow beats deny); Rule 2 across (allow = ∩, deny = ∪) |
| `OrdinalControl` | a single enum value | strictest-of, on an **enforcer-owned** scale |
| `CapabilityGate` | `{enabled, scopes{…ruleset}}` | `enabled` = AND; each scope is a ScopedRuleset |
| `ScopedMap` | `{members: ruleset, posture{…}}` | members = ScopedRuleset; `posture` is policy-only |

**Enforcer-owned registries** (never sourced from a governed file, so no profile
can reorder strictness or redefine matching):

- `_ORDINAL_SCALES`: `approval = yolo < auto < interactive`;
  `sandbox = off < standard < cc < strict` (verified against `sandbox.py`).
- `_MATCHERS` — exactly **five**: `identifier` (case-insensitive), `command`
  (case-sensitive `fnmatchcase`), `path`, `host`, and `mcp` (a `@server` grant covers
  `@server/tool`). An earlier revision also listed `bundle_id` and `cu_action` "both
  added for computer use"; they were removed with that governance model and naming
  either in a `ScopedRuleset` raises `PlatformCompositionError: unknown matcher`,
  which under `boot.fail_closed` aborts governance boot — so this list is
  load-bearing, not descriptive. Extend it only through
  `register_matcher`/`register_scope`, which validate the name.
  The `path` matcher normalizes **only the queried item** (`_norm_item`: expand
  `~`/`$VAR` → `os.path.abspath`, which anchors a relative path to the host CWD
  and collapses `.`/`..`) and matches it against the operator's pattern **expanded
  but otherwise verbatim**. This does two jobs and avoids one trap:
  (1) a `..` traversal cannot satisfy an allow-prefix (`/home/u/ws/../.bashrc`
  collapses to `/home/u/.bashrc` and no longer matches `/home/u/ws/**`, which an
  un-normalized `*` would wrongly span); (2) an agent-supplied **relative** item
  is absolutized so it can still match an absolute *deny* glob (`../../etc/passwd`
  cannot dodge `/etc/**` by failing to match). The pattern is **never** run
  through `normpath` — `normpath` treats `*`/`**` as ordinary segments and would
  collapse an adjacent `..` against them (`/a/**/../b` → `/a/b`, silently dropping
  the `**`), widening an allow or shrinking a deny. Normalization is purely
  lexical (no filesystem `resolve()`), so it is mode-safe and adds no I/O; the
  `abspath` anchor cannot reconstruct an ACP backend's actual CWD, so the
  resolved `is_sensitive_path` keystone remains the separate, always-on,
  authoritative block for the trust-root / credential dirs. `_norm_item` also
  collapses a leading `//` to `/` (POSIX leaves a two-slash prefix
  implementation-defined and `normpath` preserves it, so `//etc/passwd` would
  otherwise dodge a `/etc/**` deny while the OS opens `/etc/passwd`).

  **Path matcher — lexical-only contract.** The `path` matcher does **not**
  resolve symlinks (no `realpath`): a symlink lexically inside an allow-prefix
  (`<allow>/link -> <secret>/key`) passes the matcher even though the OS write
  lands outside the allow-list. This is intentional — resolving would add I/O to
  every gate call and refuse writes through operator-placed symlinks. Treat
  allow-mode prefixes as a **lexical scoping aid, not a hardened sandbox against
  symlinks**; the resolved `is_sensitive_path` keystone is the authoritative
  guard for trust-root / credential dirs, and operators must not rely on an
  allow-mode prefix to confine writes in a directory containing untrusted
  symlinks.

`SCOPE_CATALOG` is the single place a scope name binds to its archetype +
matcher. `register_scope` / `register_matcher` are append-only extension seams;
the test suite proves a synthetic scope resolves end-to-end with **zero**
evaluator edits.

## Loading + precedence

`load_security_policy()` precedence, highest first. The centrally distributed
document is the **authority**; every tier below it may only **tighten** it:

1. **the centrally distributed document** — fetched from `KIROCREW_POLICY_URL` or
   from the `distribution.source` a lower tier declares, served from the
   last-known-good cache when the endpoint is unreachable. See
   [Central distribution](#central-distribution-distribution--policy-only).
2. `KIROCREW_SECURITY_POLICY` env path — the local operator channel.
3. companion-bundled resource (the `amazon` edition packages it; the public core
   passes `None`).
4. `~/.kiro/crew/security_policy.json` — standalone operator-authored.
5. none → `None` → editable secure-defaults (ungoverned ceiling).

**Tiers 2–4 are mutually exclusive** (first present wins among them) and
collectively form the *subordinate*; tier 1 stacks above it. The composed result
is `central ∘ subordinate` under `_intersect_ceilings`, which reuses
`_compose_controls` — the same per-scope AND the profile layer uses (allow∩, deny∪,
ordinal=stricter, gate=AND) — so "a lower tier cannot widen" is a property of the
primitive rather than a rule the loader polices. A scope the subordinate governs
and the authority does not carries through, because an ungoverned scope is
*unrestricted* and adding a restriction to it is a tightening; a scope the
authority governs and the subordinate omits keeps the authority's value, because a
subordinate cannot repeal by omission. One scope inside `controls` has no compose
archetype: the reserved sandbox boot flags (`sandbox.require_isolation`,
`sandbox.env_scrub_prefixes`) ride as a plain mapping under `sandbox._flags`, and
`_intersect_ceilings` merges that mapping per key — the authority's value where both
tiers set one, the subordinate's where the authority was silent — rather than handing
it to `_compose_controls`, which would refuse it as a type mismatch and abort boot on
an ordinary two-tier configuration. The flags are inert (nothing reads them), so
neither direction can widen the ceiling. Everything outside `controls` stays the
**authority's** — identity, signature state, tier and the `updates` *commands* — so a
subordinate document cannot relabel whose ceiling this is or supply a command the
gateway would run unsandboxed. The two `updates` pins that are themselves restrictions
fold instead (`_intersect_update_pins`): `updates.source` is an allowlist and
`updates.min_version` a floor, so a subordinate that sets one the authority left empty
narrows the ceiling and keeps it; where both set one, the authority's source stands and
the higher floor wins. Keeping "the authority's" there would have voided a pure
tightening — an empty source pin permits any remote, so a central document silent on
updates plus a local source pin would have composed to "install from anywhere". Two
things follow a declared-wins rule instead, because for them "the authority's" is only
meaningful when the authority actually said something:

- `fallback`: **authority-only**, not declared-wins. An authority that declared
  none means an unusable profile file denies its whole surface, and a subordinate
  supplying a fallback there would REPLACE that floor with something looser — the
  escape hatch widened by the tier that may not widen anything. A subordinate that
  wants a fallback asks the fleet to declare one. (Listed here because it is the
  one out-of-`controls` field a reader expects to be declared-wins and is not.)
- the `distribution` pins: the **highest tier that declared any** supplies them, for
  every tier that takes part in the fold. A lower tier still cannot redirect a
  fetch source its authority chose — that is the property the pins exist for — but
  when no tier above it declared any there is no choice to redirect away from, and
  the fetch source a lower tier declares is exactly the self-refresh case tier 1
  above is defined in terms of. Taking "the authority's" unconditionally instead
  meant an authority silent about distribution **discarded** the pins beneath it,
  switching the central tier off and dropping every centrally supplied restriction.
  `compose_tier_ladder` tracks the effective value as the fold proceeds and
  re-applies it on every exit, so no path that rebuilds a ceiling can drop it.
  An **unusable home file beneath a present authority is skipped, not raised**
  (`_subordinate_ceiling(beneath_authority=True)`, one warning per process) --
  unreadable, not JSON, JSON that `parse_policy` rejects, or bytes on which verifying
  or parsing raises anything at all (the catch is total at this one boundary), one
  path for every shape so JSON validity does not split the behaviour. The home
  `distribution` peek that runs before the central document is known is a lookup for
  a declared source, not a ruling on the file: a malformed block declares no source
  and the peek moves on, leaving skip-or-fatal to `_subordinate_ceiling`, which
  re-parses the home document only when the home tier is the one selected. The
  authority governs unchanged, which is the fail-closed direction, whereas raising
  -- the behaviour when the home file is the only ceiling -- would let whoever owns
  `~/.kiro/crew` refuse boot and freeze every refresh on a fleet host.
  "Declared" is read from the **presence** of the block, not from its values
  (`PolicyDistribution.explicit`, set by `from_dict`, outside `__eq__`): a central
  document that spells out `on_unavailable: fail_closed` -- the default -- has
  expressed a choice, and a value-only test read it as silence, which let a lower
  tier's `degrade` replace the fleet's outage disposition through the ordinary
  two-channel split.

The fold itself is **`compose_tier_ladder`**, the single implementation of
precedence: highest present tier is the authority, and each lower one may only tighten
it. There is deliberately no path by which a lower tier replaces the authority. A
central refresh re-runs that same function through `compose_installed_ceiling` (see
[The live swap](#the-live-swap-and-the-cache-it-invalidates)), so boot and refresh
cannot drift — there is only one implementation of precedence to drift from.

Each distinct composition pair is audited **once per process**
(`security_policy_tier_intersect`, latched on the `(authority, lower)` pair in
`_TierProcessState.tier_intersects_audited`) with the tier NAMES only — module constants this process
authored, never a path or URL from the document, the same rule the distribution
audit follows. Once, because `load_security_policy` runs per app callback and the
pairs it folds do not change between calls; a row per compose was a row per
interaction for a fact that never changed, burying the one-time env-inversion
signal. A tier that appears later (an env document set after boot) is a new pair
and is still recorded.

**Why the env tier no longer outranks the central push.** It used to, as the
rollback lever for a bad central document. That made the enterprise ceiling
advisory: any account that can set an environment variable could point it at a
permissive file and the fleet's ceiling never bound.

A time-boxed local override (a dated `break_glass` grant an authority document could issue to a lower tier) was designed for this change and **withdrawn before merge**: a channel by which a local document outranks the fleet ceiling is the override this ladder exists to remove, and the reviewed design carried its own expiry-handling and cache-trust defects. Recovery from a bad central push is by re-publishing a good document at the source. The override is tracked as the follow-up issue [#9106](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues/9106), not shipped here.

**The inversion announces itself once.** An upgraded fleet whose runbook still reads
"set `KIROCREW_SECURITY_POLICY` to roll back" would otherwise learn mid-incident that the
file now only tightens. So the first time an env document composes **beneath** the
central authority, `_warn_env_beneath_central_once` logs a warning and writes one
best-effort SEL row (`security_policy_env_tightens_only`, `<authority><-env`), latched by
`_TierProcessState.env_beneath_central_warned` for the process lifetime. An env document governing alone,
or a home document beneath an authority, is not an inversion and is not announced.

The home path (step 4) is resolved through the **lazy `_policy_home_path()`
accessor**, never a module-level `config_dir()` capture — so importing
`platform.governance` (or `platform.admission`, whose `_policy_default_path()` /
`_seed_marker_path()` / `_checksum_path()` follow the same pattern) never
triggers `config_dir()` and thus never fires the one-time data-home migration as
an import side effect. The migration runs only at the single chosen point
(`ensure_data_home()` in the CLI prologue, before any `asyncio.run`), keeping the
platform layer side-effect-free load-bearing infrastructure. Tests patch these
accessors, not captured constants.

A **present-but-unreadable / invalid** policy raises `PlatformCompositionError`
(fail-closed to strictest), mirroring `admission.load_admission_policy`. Parsing
is **pure-Python and structural** (it does not depend on `jsonschema`, which is
an optional, possibly-absent dependency) so a malformed policy never silently
degrades to ungoverned.

## Update pins (`updates`) — policy-only

Replacing the running code is the widest privileged action the host performs: a
self-update rewrites every other ceiling in this document, because the deny
catalog, the sensitive-path list and the evaluator are *code*. Two enterprise
pins ride in the policy file for it:

```json
"updates": {
  "source": "https://git.corp.example/platform/*",
  "min_version": "1.4.0"
}
```

- **`source`** — an fnmatch glob over the git remote URL new code may come from
  (a glob so one pin covers a mirror set, and so non-URL remote shapes —
  SCP-style, local path — are pinnable). Empty = unpinned. A checkout whose
  remote cannot be resolved is **denied when a pin exists**: an admin's pin must
  not be satisfied by "we could not tell".
- **`min_version`** — the minimum version the fleet may run. A host below it
  takes a **mandatory** update, overriding the user's `auto_update=false`
  (user config sits under the enterprise ceiling). It never refuses to *boot*:
  bricking a fleet on a policy typo would remove the surface an admin needs to
  fix it. An unparseable floor imposes none, for the same reason.

**Not an archetype, by design.** Every archetype answers "is X permitted?"; a
remote URL and a version number are *values the core consumes*. So they ride
outside `controls` — no `SCOPE_CATALOG` row, no matcher, no evaluator change.
What makes them enterprise-*pinnable* is the file they live in: the trust-root
`security_policy.json` is on the `security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` keystone, so the
agent can neither read nor write its own ceiling. A `config.json` field or an env
var would only be a suggestion.

**Policy-only — rejected in a Level-2 profile** (`parse_profile` raises). A
profile is narrow-only and there is no narrower version of *pointing somewhere
else*; a per-app profile that could redirect the update source would be
privilege escalation.

`platform/update_governance.py` is the one seam the three update paths share
(`POST /api/update`, `kirocrew update`, the gateway-boot auto-apply) so they
cannot drift. It resolves the remote git would *actually* fetch from — reading
`branch.<name>.remote` rather than assuming `origin`, via `ls-remote --get-url`
so `url.<base>.insteadOf` rewriting is applied — and returns a blocking reason or
`""`. **A pin blocks; an unresolvable pin does not:** if governance cannot be read
at all the update proceeds, because refusing one would strand a host on a build
that may need a patch. These are a routing constraint for a managed fleet, not a
boundary against a local operator who could edit the checkout directly.

**Roll the build before the pin.** The parser fails closed on an unknown key, so a
build predating `updates` refuses to boot on a pinned policy — which inverts the
`min_version` case, since the stale hosts a floor targets are exactly the ones
that would stop booting. Recovery is a manual `kirocrew update`.

## Central distribution (`distribution`) — policy-only

`platform/policy_distribution.py` is how an enterprise IT admin owns **one**
`security_policy.json` and every machine in the fleet follows it. Each host fetches
the document from a central location, keeps the last-known-good copy on disk, and
re-fetches on an interval, so a pushed change binds **without a restart, a
redeploy, or a visit to the host**. This closes the gap the field manual named
outright: distribution used to be entirely the customer's config-management
tooling, with no seam on this side of it.

`GovernanceCeiling.distribution` is the parsed declaration; the module is the
engine. Like [`updates`](#update-pins-updates--policy-only) it is **not an
archetype** — every archetype answers "is X permitted?", while a URL and an
interval are values the core consumes — so it rides outside `controls` with no
`SCOPE_CATALOG` row, no matcher, and no evaluator change.

```json
"distribution": {
  "source": "https://config.corp.example/kirocrew/policy.json",
  "refresh_interval_secs": 900,
  "max_cache_age_secs": 86400,
  "on_unavailable": "fail_closed"
}
```

**Policy-only — rejected in a Level-2 profile** (`parse_profile` raises). This is a
stronger version of the `updates` argument, not the same one: redirecting where the
ceiling is *fetched from* is not a narrowing at all, it replaces the whole
enforcement document, which is the widest escalation the model has.

### Two source channels, and why the split

| Channel | Where | For |
|---|---|---|
| `KIROCREW_POLICY_URL` (+ the `KIROCREW_POLICY_*` siblings) | per-machine env | The **fleet lever** — the same role `KIROCREW_SECURITY_POLICY` plays. A config-management push sets one variable; no file to place, no package to rebuild. |
| `distribution.source` in a policy any other tier supplies | the policy document | **Self-refresh.** A fleet places one bootstrap policy once (or an edition bundles it) and that document names where its own successors come from. |

The env channel wins **per setting**, so a host can be redirected to a canary
endpoint or have its interval lengthened during an incident without editing — and
re-signing — the published document.

**No credentials in the document, and no provenance flag either.** `distribution`
has no `headers` field on purpose: a document published to the whole fleet must not
carry a per-machine secret, and this one is additionally copied into a local cache
and reported on by the read-only viewer. A request credential comes from
`KIROCREW_POLICY_HEADERS` (a JSON object) instead. There is likewise no
`require_signature` key — a document must not be the authority on whether it has to
be authentic, which is exactly what `_policy_trust_settings` already refuses by name
("an attacker rewriting the policy would simply clear it"). Mandating provenance is
`require_policy_signature` in the admission policy, which is on the keystone and
which a fetched document cannot reach.

The peek runs in the same order the tiers themselves do — the
`KIROCREW_SECURITY_POLICY` document, then bundled, then home — so where a source may be
declared and which declaration wins are one question rather than two. The env document
belongs in that chain because it is tier 2, above bundled and home; its absence from the
chain meant an operator who put `distribution.source` in the file
`KIROCREW_SECURITY_POLICY` names got no central tier at all. That document is read once
and handed down to the subordinate tier, so the peek and the tier cannot disagree about
its bytes.

The peek that resolves a declaration (`_declared_distribution`)
deliberately validates **only** the `distribution` key. A policy whose other keys
are malformed must fail at its own tier with its own message; a malformed
`distribution` block does raise, because a fleet that mistyped where its ceiling
comes from must not silently get none.

### Availability: the cache is the whole point

A ceiling a network can withhold is a ceiling a network can *remove*, so two
failures pull in opposite directions and get opposite answers.

**The endpoint is unreachable.** The cached last-known-good copy is served, and that
is the normal answer — a host does not lose governance because a bucket had a bad
minute. `max_cache_age_secs` is the fleet's staleness bound (0 = none); past it, and
with no cache at all, `on_unavailable` decides:

- `fail_closed` (**the default**) aborts boot. A fleet that pointed a host at a
  central ceiling meant that ceiling to bind, so "we could not tell" must not read
  as "run unbounded". Recovery is `KIROCREW_POLICY_ON_UNAVAILABLE=degrade` or unsetting
  `KIROCREW_POLICY_URL`; a local policy file is not a lever here, since it only tightens
  whatever ceiling ends up in force.
- `degrade` falls through to the next precedence tier and records a
  `mark_governance_incident("degraded", …)` so the dashboard indicator shows it.

A cache recorded against a **different** source is ignored: serving it would let a
retired endpoint keep governing a host that has been repointed, including a repoint
made specifically to replace a compromised source.

**A refused document is not an outage.** `on_unavailable` answers "the ceiling could
not be REACHED"; a document this host read and REFUSED is a different question. It
still yields to a usable cache — that is a ceiling the fleet published and this host
verified — but with no usable cache it **raises regardless of the disposition**,
because falling through to a lower tier would demote the host onto a policy the
administrator superseded.

**The pushed document is bad.** At boot there is nothing to fall back to, so it fails
like any other tier. On a **live refresh it is REJECTED and the running ceiling is
kept** — `apply_ceiling` runs `assert_policy_signature_satisfied` **and**
`assert_profile_floor` on the **composed** candidate (the fetched document folded back
into the tier ladder) before installing it, so a refresh can never install a ceiling
this host would have refused to start under. That asymmetry is what stops one typo
taking down a fleet that is already up. A refused document is **never cached**, so a
rejection does not persist as a poisoned last-known-good after the push is corrected.

### The live swap, and the cache it invalidates

**A local file is never a reason for a refresh to stand down.** `KIROCREW_SECURITY_POLICY` is a subordinate tier that *tightens* the fetched ceiling, so the refresher keeps polling with one present; a poll that installs a tighter central document is composed with the local one, not blocked by it. There is no local channel that outranks the central document (see the precedence section above for the withdrawn `break_glass` design).

**Validate, then publish, then install** — in that order, and the order is the point. A
cache-only child adopts whatever the cache holds, so installing before publishing leaves a
window where the gateway enforces the new ceiling and a freshly-spawned app backend adopts
the retired one; publishing before validating would hand that child a document this host is
about to refuse. `validate_ceiling` is the check split out of `apply_ceiling` so the refresh
can prove the candidate before it writes anything.

The publish is then **confirmed by reading it back**. `write_cache` is best-effort by
design — a host that cannot write it is still governed by what it fetched — but a
cache-only child inherits the ceiling *from that file*, so a swallowed write failure would
leave the gateway enforcing a tighter ceiling while every app backend spawned afterwards
adopted the looser one. A failed publish keeps the running ceiling and reports `rejected`.

**A refresh recomposes the ladder; it does not install the fetched document alone.**
`apply_ceiling` calls `compose_installed_ceiling(fetched)` first, which re-reads the
subordinate tier and folds both rungs through the same `compose_tier_ladder` the loader
uses. Installing the fetched rung by itself would drop every local restriction **below**
it, so a host a fleet tightened at boot would find that tightening gone at its first successful poll
— a ceiling that loosens itself on a timer. One composition function on both paths is
the invariant: boot and refresh cannot diverge, because there is only one
implementation of precedence to diverge from.

The bundled tier is the one rung a recomposition cannot re-derive — only the edition
that booted the process supplies a `bundled_loader` — so `load_security_policy`
remembers the document it resolved in `_TierProcessState.last_bundled` and
`compose_installed_ceiling` reads it from there. Without that, the bundled tier would silently drop out of the
ladder at the first refresh, loosening a ceiling an edition tightened. The packaged
resource is static for the process lifetime, so caching it is sound.

`apply_ceiling` then validates that **composed** result the way boot does — so the
floor gates judge what will actually govern rather than one rung of it — and installs
it with `set_context(replace(current_context(), governance=…))`. Every enforcement
chokepoint reads `current_context().governance` per decision rather than capturing
it, so the swap binds on the next call.

The validation is `assert_policy_signature_satisfied` plus
**`assert_profile_floor`** — the ordinal half of the boot gate, split out from
`assert_profiles_within_ceiling` so the name says which half a caller gets. The
boot gate's extra unrecoverable-profile refusal is deliberately NOT applied here:
it is about the profile store's state rather than about the ceiling, and honouring
it mid-session would let one unreadable local file block every future fleet policy
change on the host — including a tightening — which is the same global-deny
outcome the runtime disposition above already rejects.

**A `304` re-validates against the trust root.** "Unchanged" is a statement about the
DOCUMENT, and the trust root is a separate input on its own schedule: a fleet turning on
`require_policy_signature` or rotating a trust key makes the running ceiling untrusted
without the endpoint publishing anything, so an unconditional `unchanged` would let it
stand indefinitely. The cached body is re-parsed on every unchanged poll, which is cheap at
one per interval.

**A `304` re-folds the ladder too.** The digest comparison below answers only "is the
central document the one installed"; a subordinate tier can change on its own schedule,
and a tightening landing there between two central publishes would otherwise reach the
running ceiling only when the central body next changed — a host looser than its own
local file for as long as the endpoint stayed quiet. So the unchanged
path calls `_recompose_differs`, which folds the ladder exactly as `apply_ceiling` does
and compares the result **structurally** with the installed ceiling (`GovernanceCeiling`
is a frozen dataclass; no second digest is kept — the installed ceiling is the record of
the last fold). Only when they differ is `apply_ceiling` run; a genuinely unchanged poll
keeps the installed object and its generation untouched, so nothing keyed on the
generation is invalidated for a no-op. gatewayd's per-app-call `load_security_policy`
never had this gap — it re-reads every tier on every call — so the fix closes the
refresher-installed plane, the only one that could go stale.

**A `304` is judged against the installed ceiling, not the cache.** The cache is
written by other processes too (gatewayd's per-app-call reload, an app backend's
boot, `kirocrew policy fetch`), so "the source has nothing newer than the cache"
does not imply "this process is already running it". `refresh_now` keeps the digest
of the document it installed and adopts the cached body when the two differ;
without that, one `policy fetch` would cache a new revision and the poller would
report `unchanged` forever while the gateway kept enforcing the old one. An EMPTY
digest means this process does not know what it installed — a boot that degraded
to ungoverned, or one whose central rung was off — and the cached body is adopted
rather than skipped, so such a host is not left permanently below a ceiling another
process on it had already cached. Adoption cannot loosen the ladder: the
candidate is folded through the loader's ladder in `apply_ceiling` before it is
validated or installed, so every local restriction below it stays in effect.

One cache did have to change. `context.set_context` — routed through the single
`_install` writer, so no install site can forget — now bumps
`context.governance_generation()`, and `governance_profiles._ceiling_token()` folds
that counter into the `ProfileStore` freshness key alongside the
fallback-declared boolean. The boolean alone could not carry it: swapping one
declared fallback for a **different** one leaves it `True` on both sides, so the
store would keep serving profiles composed against the retired ceiling. The
ceiling used to be boot-frozen, which is why nothing needed this before.

### Transport is a seam

`register_policy_fetcher(scheme, fetcher)` is append-only, mirroring
`register_scope`/`register_matcher`. Built-ins: `https`, `file`, and `http`
**restricted to loopback hosts** (a clear-text ceiling is substitutable in transit
by anyone on the path; a local management relay is a legitimate shape). An edition
that needs request signing for its own object store, or a management channel that is
not HTTP at all, registers a fetcher at import time — exactly where the Amazon
edition already registers its scopes — and inherits the cache, the signature
verification, the refresh loop and every disposition unchanged.

An **unknown scheme raises** rather than reading as unreachable: a typo'd `htps://`
will never start working, so it must not quietly hand the host to the cache. A
**conflicting registration also raises** — `register_scope`'s refusal to let a typo
shadow a built-in matters most in the registry that decides which code fetches the
ceiling — and there is deliberately no override flag, because the precedent has none
either.

**`http` is loopback-only, decided by `ipaddress`** rather than a set of literal
spellings: the whole `127.0.0.0/8` block and every form of IPv6 loopback count, so
a local management relay on `127.0.0.2` works, and a name that is not an address is
never loopback (resolving it would make the decision depend on the network the
check exists to distrust).

Fetching follows the house pattern in `apps/official_catalog.py`: a per-call opener
with a `_NoRedirects` handler (a 3xx that changes origin contradicts "TLS to the
address the operator named", and the scheme guard cannot see it because it validates
the URL we *ask* for), a `MAX_POLICY_BYTES` cap read one byte long so an over-large
body is detected rather than truncated into a document that parses as something
narrower than what was published, and a bounded timeout because a cold cache puts
this on the boot path. Conditional requests (`If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since`,
and an mtime validator for `file://`) mean an unchanged document costs no body; a
`304` **restarts the cached copy's age**, since it proves those bytes are the
published document right now.

The `file://` fetcher opens **once** and judges the size on the open handle, requiring
a regular file: stat-then-read is two trips to a path anything sharing the mount can
replace in between, so a swapped-in oversized file would defeat the ceiling and a FIFO
would make the read block forever — a boot that hangs rather than fails. Its validator is
a **content digest**, not `mtime:size`, which a size-preserving replacement with a kept
timestamp (`cp -p`, a restored backup, a deliberate `touch`) slips past — leaving the
previous, potentially looser ceiling enforced while every poll reports "unchanged".

It also **refuses a source the account Kiro Crew runs as can write — the file or any
ancestor directory.** A distribution source
this account can rewrite is one an agent subprocess can rewrite — it runs as the same uid —
and the refresher would then install that ceiling without even a restart. The field manual
already tells operators to distribute to a read-only, root-owned path; this makes it a
precondition rather than advice, and the refusal names
`KIROCREW_SECURITY_POLICY` as the channel designed for a local, editable policy. The
**ancestor walk** is what makes the check mean anything: a `0444` file inside a writable
directory is replaceable by unlink-and-recreate, so a leaf-only check would accept a forged
read-only document. Decided from the mode bits on the already-open handle
(`platform_compat.stat_writable_by_current_user`) plus `path_writable_by_current_user` for
the chain. Both are POSIX-only, since Windows permissions are an ACL and the mode bits
carry no usable answer there — and **off POSIX they answer `True`: "cannot tell" rounds to
writable.** **Two chains are walked, the path as written and the path as resolved.** Resolving first and
walking only the target was a gap: re-pointing a symlink needs no permission on the link and
none on the target — it needs write on the *link's parent*, which the resolved chain never
visits. So a root-owned, read-only document reached through a link in a directory this account
can write is a source this account controls. A symlink's own mode bits are meaningless on Linux
(0777 and ignored), so nothing is judged by them; what matters is the directories, and each
chain contributes some the other does not.

Each component is tested twice — against the mode bits, and against the kernel's own answer
via `os.access(..., effective_ids=True)`. The second is the only one that sees a **POSIX
ACL**: a named-user entry (`user:me:w` on a file owned by someone else) does not appear in
`st_mode` at all, since the group bits show the ACL *mask* rather than that entry, so a
mode-only check called such a source read-only. On POSIX, **ownership alone is enough**,
without the write bit: an owner may
`chmod` its own file, so a `0444` file this account owns is one it can make writable and
then rewrite — the exact move the threat model describes, since the agent subprocess runs
as the same uid. The same reasoning covers a directory in the ancestor walk (owning it
means being able to unlink and recreate what is inside), and running as **root** makes
everything writable whatever the mode says. Group ownership does *not* confer that power —
only the owner and root may `chmod` — so there the write bit is still the question. The
practical effect is that a legitimate source must be owned by a *different* account, which
is what the field manual already tells operators (a read-only, root-owned path). There is no abstaining option for this predicate, because the caller refuses a
writable source: a `False` would not withhold judgement, it would assert the source is
safe and admit every Windows `file://` source unchecked, including one an agent had just
planted. So a Windows operator loses the `file://` channel (`https://` is unaffected)
until the DACL can actually be read. On POSIX the ids compared are the **union of the
real and effective** uid and gid plus the supplementary list, not `os.getgroups()` alone:
POSIX leaves it unspecified whether the effective gid appears in the supplementary list,
so a process that reached its gid through `setegid` — or one in a container built without
`initgroups` — has a primary group that list never mentions, and a membership test alone
would call a group-writable source we *can* replace safe. A **loopback**
request additionally installs an empty `ProxyHandler`: urllib has no implicit loopback
exemption, so with `HTTP_PROXY` set a request to `127.0.0.1` is sent to the proxy in
absolute form *with the request headers*, which would hand the fleet's credential to
the proxy and let it answer with a substituted ceiling. A remote `https` source keeps
the default handler, because there a corporate proxy is the intended path.

### Cache layout, and why it is on the keystone

`<data-home>/policy_cache/` holds `policy.json` (the document verbatim, so its
signature still verifies) and `policy.meta.json` (`source_digest`, `fetched_at`, `etag`,
`last_modified`, `digest`).

**Malformed input is refused, not crashed on.** Two shapes a typo produces made a library
call raise out of the very check meant to reject it. `urlsplit` raises `ValueError` on a
malformed bracketed host (`https://[::1`), so a declared source now yields a composition error
naming the key, and every runtime site in the engine goes through a never-raising `_split_url`
— the redaction one matters most, because a sanitiser that crashes on a malformed source takes
the error *report* down with it and the operator sees a traceback about URL parsing instead of
the problem they have. `SplitResult.port` is a *lazily parsed* property, so guarding `urlsplit` does not cover it — it
raises for a non-numeric or out-of-range port. A declared source with one is a composition error
naming the key; the engine's own identity function falls back to the raw netloc text, since an
identity needs stability rather than a number and two spellings of an unusable port are not a
repoint between them. Every duration is bounded by `MAX_DURATION_SECS`
(`threading.TIMEOUT_MAX`) on **both** channels from one constant, because that is what the
platform can actually *wait* for: the refresher passes the interval to `Event.wait` and a fetch
passes the timeout to a socket, and both raise `OverflowError` above it — silently killing the
poller thread, so the host simply stops receiving policy updates. Not an invented policy limit at
~292 years; it bounds typos rather than intentions. The environment channel needs it as much as the
document does, since a merely *large* finite value (`1e12`) passes the finiteness screen. And
`math.isfinite` converts its argument to a float first, so a JSON integer of 310 digits raised
`OverflowError` inside the finiteness screen; it is asked only of
floats now (an int has no non-finite values), and the value is stored without a `float()`
round-trip, which would have raised three lines later.

**A DECLARED source may not carry a credential.** `PolicyDistribution.from_dict` refuses
userinfo (`https://user:pass@host/…`) and any query string in a `distribution.source` that
comes from a *document*. This block is cached verbatim — the bytes have to be identical for
the signature to verify — and `policy.json` is readable by an app backend, so a credential
placed there would be published to every host and then handed to every app. It is the rule
this module already stated (the per-machine credential travels in
`KIROCREW_POLICY_HEADERS`, which "a published document must not" carry) made enforceable
rather than advisory. The **environment** channel is deliberately unrestricted: that is where
a pre-signed URL belongs, it is set by whatever provisions the host, and it never lands in
the document.

**The recorded identity is what SELECTS the document, not what authenticates the request.** The
fragment and the basic-auth *password* are dropped — but not the username, which names the account:
two tenants at one host and path are two different documents, and collapsing them would leave
tenant A's possibly looser ceiling in force after a repoint to tenant B. Scheme and host are
lowercased, and the query parameters that
carry a *signature* are removed by name — `x-amz-*` and `x-goog-*` for SigV4 and Google's copy of
it, plus Azure Blob's short SAS names (`sig`, `sv`, `sr`, `sp`, …) — those only when the query is
*positively* a SAS, meaning it carries both `sig` and `sv`, since unlike the namespaced families
these names are short enough to be somebody else's selector (`?sp=team-a` reads perfectly well as
"policy = team-a"). A pre-signed URL is the
documented shape for the environment channel and its signature *rotates* by design, so hashing
the whole URL made every rotation look like a repoint: the cache was discarded as a retired
endpoint's copy, and a host that then hit a transient outage had no last-known-good and aborted
startup under the fail-closed default, without anyone having done anything.

Every *other* query parameter stays in, because a query can also select the document.
`?policy=team-a` and `?policy=team-b` are different sources, and collapsing them would let a
repoint to a *stricter* policy keep serving the looser one — indefinitely on a boot-only source,
which never re-fetches once a ceiling is established. Kept parameters are sorted, so a re-issue
that merely reorders them is not a repoint either.

A name list rather than a heuristic on the value, and deliberately small, because the two
mistakes are not symmetric: an unknown presigning scheme stays in the identity, so a rotation
discards the cache and costs one fetch — bounded, and visible. Wrongly dropping a
document-selecting parameter costs a superseded ceiling staying in force.

**The metadata records a DIGEST of the source, never the source.** The URL can *be* the
credential — a pre-signed object-store link carries its signature in the query string —
and this module's rule is that the source is emitted nowhere, so storing it made the cache
the one place that broke that rule. It also matters concretely: the app backend reads this
file. The field's only consumer is an equality test (the repoint rule), and an equality
test does not need the plaintext. A cache written before this carries the plaintext under
`source`; it is hashed on read rather than discarded, so an upgrade keeps its
last-known-good copy and the next write replaces the file with the digest form. The `digest` is what makes the pair **provably one write**:
two files means two writes, so overlapping writers can leave a NEW document beside OLD
metadata — and that pair is not merely stale, because the metadata's `source` is what the
repoint rule trusts, so a tear could hand a repointed host the retired endpoint's document
under the new endpoint's name. A mismatch reads as no cache at all, and the caller
fetches. Metadata written by a build without the field is still accepted, so an existing
cache does not read as torn. Both are written through the shared
[`atomic_write`](../../../src/kiro_crew/atomic_write.py) — never a hand-rolled temp +
rename, which is how earlier writers here lost the Windows rename retry — and
document-before-metadata, so a process killed mid-write leaves a consistent pair or a
new document with old metadata, never metadata promising a document that is not
there. `write_cache` must not run on the event loop, because `replace_with_retry`
skips its Windows sharing-violation retry when it detects one.

The digest **detects** a tear; a cross-process lock keeps one from being written in the
first place. `write_cache` and `touch_cache` both run under `_cache_write_lock`, an
exclusive lock on `policy_cache/policy.lock`, because two writers is the ordinary case and
not a corner: the gateway's refresher thread polls on its interval while
`kirocrew policy fetch --force` runs from a shell, and a forced write (new document, new
digest) interleaving with a 304 touch (metadata only, carrying the digest read
beforehand) persists NEW bytes against an OLD digest. Readers then discard the pair, so
the cost is the last-known-good copy vanishing during the outage that made the refresh
fail. **Readers are deliberately not locked** — they already revalidate the digest and
retry, so they degrade to one transient miss, and locking them would put a boot behind a
mutex a hung refresher holds. The lock file is opened `O_NOFOLLOW` and required to be a
lone regular inode (the `memory.py` idiom), and a lock that cannot be taken **skips the
write**: proceeding unlocked could destroy a good pair, while skipping preserves it.

**The lock alone is not enough, because `touch_cache` reads before it locks.** Its `meta`
argument was captured by the caller, so a forced write landing in between leaves the touch
about to stamp the OLD digest over metadata describing NEW bytes — the same tear, reached
by a stale read rather than an interleaved write. The metadata is therefore re-read INSIDE
the lock and the touch is a **compare-and-swap**: skipped unless the digest and source
still describe the document this caller validated. Skipping is right rather than merely
safe, because the writer that got there first recorded a fresher fetch of the same source,
so there is no age left to restart.

**A refused install does not leave the rejected bytes as the last-known-good.** The
publish is confirmed before the install, so the new document is on disk before
`apply_ceiling` has had its say — and that step refuses for reasons the earlier
`validate_ceiling` cannot see (a bound profile, the trust root, or a subordinate tier that moved
between the two). `refresh_now` snapshots the prior copy and `_restore_cache` puts it back
on any failure — **invalidating first, then writing** — carrying its original `fetched_at` so a repeatedly-failing refresh cannot
keep resetting the staleness clock. **The rollback is itself a compare-and-swap**, on the
document this refresh published: `apply_ceiling` sits between the publish and the failure,
so another process can publish in that window, and rolling back over it would destroy a
valid newer ceiling nobody asked us to touch. When the digests disagree the newer copy is
left alone — this refresh's document is no longer the one on disk, so there is nothing of
ours to undo.

The invalidate-then-write ordering is what makes a partial failure safe. The bytes on disk
at that moment are the ones this host just *refused*, so a restoring write that fails after
the delete leaves the cache **absent** — a cache-only child fails closed (a disabled app,
loudly) and the next boot re-fetches. Writing over them first and failing halfway would
leave the rejected document as the last-known-good, which is the one outcome this exists to
prevent. The gap is held under the lock, and the gateway's own ceiling is untouched
throughout. A restore that fails outright is reported at ERROR with a `degraded` governance
incident rather than a quiet warning, because `refresh_now` cannot raise (it runs on a
background timer) and that log is the only signal the host has lost its outage fallback. When there is no prior copy to restore — the first
refresh on a host, or a prior copy from a different source, which the repoint rule already
says is not this source's last-known-good — the published bytes are **removed** rather than
left in place. That is not the same trade-off as keeping a stale-but-composable copy: these
are the bytes this host just *refused*. Kept, the next boot serves them from cache instead
of re-fetching, so a source the administrator has since corrected does not reach the host
until the window expires, and a cache-only child adopts the refused ceiling meanwhile. With
no cache, boot fetches and either gets the fix or fails exactly as it would have anyway.

**The publish is a compare-and-swap, and the snapshot is taken BEFORE the fetch.** A fetch
is slow and a refresh is not the only writer: a refresher that fetched v2 over a slow link
while `kirocrew policy fetch --force` published v3 would write v2 over v3 and then *install*
v2 — the ceiling moving backward to a looser document, the one direction this tier must
never move on its own. `write_cache` takes an `expect_pair` checked inside the lock — the
`(body digest, source digest)` the caller observed, `("", "")` for no cache, `None` to
publish unconditionally — and returns whether it published. **The pair, not the body
alone**: identical bytes can be published for a DIFFERENT source (a repoint whose document
did not change), and a body-only comparison would let an in-flight refresh overwrite that
provenance with its own, which the next boot's repoint rule then discards as not belonging
to the source it resolves. The rollback swap and the lost-swap discrimination compare the
same pair.
The ordering is the control: the concurrent write lands *during* the fetch, so a snapshot
taken afterwards already includes it and the swap would pass while overwriting the newer
document. The expectation is the raw on-disk digest, deliberately not filtered by source, so
a legitimate repoint does not look like a lost race.

**Boot takes the same swap**, with the same before-the-fetch snapshot. It is not exempt: a
slow boot fetch of v2 racing a `kirocrew policy fetch --force` that publishes v3 would
otherwise overwrite the cache with v2 and install it, rolling the ceiling backward on the one
path where nothing is running yet to notice. The install is **recorded only once the publish has resolved**, because
`central_ceiling_installed` is what the gateway flags an app backend cache-only on: recording the
fetched bytes earlier meant a lost swap whose winner was then *rejected* left the host degraded
while every child was told to resolve its ceiling from a cache holding the document this host had
just refused. When the swap loses, boot must still install something and the right something is
the **winner** — so it adopts the cache rather than the
bytes it fetched, re-gated through the same parse, source-migration and `validate_ceiling`
sequence **and the repoint rule**, because "another process published it" is not evidence this
host can run under it — and that process may have been configured for a different source, which
is exactly what a lost swap makes reachable.
No further write: the winner is already the cache, and re-publishing it would be the overwrite
this path exists to avoid.

A publish that did not happen has two possible reasons, and `refresh_now` tells them apart
by re-reading — which is honest, since that was the swap's own condition. A **lost swap**
stands down and reports `unchanged`: installing what this call fetched could roll the
ceiling backward, and the next cycle finds the cache differs from what is installed and
adopts it, the path a 304 against a moved-ahead cache already takes. A **failed write** is
reported like the read-back confirmation, because it is the same operator problem.

The publish confirmation checks the recorded **source** as well as the bytes. A repoint
publishing identical bytes alongside a failed metadata write would otherwise pass a
body-only check, and it is the recorded source the next boot's repoint rule judges — so
the refresh would report success on a document a restart then discards.

A refused redirect names only the target's **scheme**, never the target. That URL comes
from the endpoint's `Location` header, so it is neither ours to publish nor covered by
`_redact_source` (which only knows the configured source), and a redirect to a pre-signed
URL would otherwise carry its signature into the boot abort text and the log ring.

**A boot publish that fails does not leave a looser cache behind.** `write_cache` is
best-effort for the *gateway* — it is governed by what it just fetched either way — but a
cache-only app backend resolves its ceiling FROM that file, so an unpublished tightening
would leave a stale, looser document as what every child spawned afterwards adopts: the
failure the cache-only handoff exists to prevent, reached through a swallowed write error.
`_discard_disagreeing_cache` therefore removes a cached pair that is not the document being
installed, so a child finds no cache and fails **closed** (a disabled app, loudly) instead
of starting under a superseded ceiling. An agreeing pair is left alone (an equal document
is not stale), and so is an absent one (there is nothing a child could adopt). If the stale
pair cannot be removed either — usually the same reason the write failed — nothing can make
the cache agree with the ceiling being adopted, and that is a boot refusal rather than
something to log and continue past.

`policy_cache` is bind-mount-hidden in **every sandbox tier** (`_STRICT_DIRS`,
`_STANDARD_DIRS`, `_CC_DIRS`) as well as being in `security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`. Both
are needed and they cover different things: `is_sensitive_path` gates the agent's
in-process TOOL CALLS, but a spawned `python -c` does an OS `open()` that never routes
through it. That distinction matters more for the cache than for the policy FILE it
copies — on a fleet using the environment channel there is no `security_policy.json` on
disk at all, so the cache is the only on-disk copy of the ceiling, and its metadata
records the SOURCE the loader trusts.

The app backend is the ONE spawn that gets a carve-out: it runs in cache-only mode, which
resolves the fleet ceiling from that file and fails closed without it, so
`apps/backend.py` passes the cache in `extra_visible_dirs` — but only when the flag is
actually set, so an ungoverned host is unchanged. Without it the two controls contradict
each other and every app backend on a centrally-governed host exits at boot. Reading the
ceiling it is about to be bound by is not an escalation: the exposure the mask exists to
prevent is the model-driven agent learning the deny patterns, and this is Kiro Crew's own
spawn rather than a tool call.

**That carve-out grants READ only where a sandbox applies, and the seal lives in `sandbox`,
not at the call site.** `extra_visible_dirs` otherwise cancels a target's whole rule set, so a caller
asking to read the cache would get WRITE with it — and an app backend is arbitrary
third-party code, so with the metadata recording the source the next boot trusts, that
would let an app pick the ceiling for every later boot on the host. Deciding it by
directory (`sandbox._is_policy_cache_dir`, matched on the leaf so it holds for the
`$HOME`-relative, legacy `~/.kirocrew`, and relocated spellings alike) means a future
caller cannot re-open the hole by passing the path:

- **Linux** drops it from the hidden list and puts it in `READONLY_DIRS`, which the
  launcher binds over itself and then **remounts** `MS_RDONLY`. Both mounts are
  load-bearing — `MS_RDONLY` is ignored on the initial `MS_BIND` — and both go through
  `_mount_or_die`, so a seal that does not land refuses the spawn rather than silently
  granting write. The sealing remount also **re-asserts the target's locked mount
  flags** (`nosuid`/`nodev`/`noexec`, read off the fresh bind via `statvfs`): inside an
  unprivileged user namespace the kernel rejects a remount that would drop a locked
  bit, so on hosts whose `/tmp` or `/home` is mounted `nosuid,nodev` the plain
  `MS_RDONLY` remount got EPERM and every spawn refused (#8386). Re-asserting bits
  already in force only keeps restrictions. `test_sandbox_mount_checked.py` pins all
  six mount sites; `test_sandbox_seal_locked_flags.py` pins the flag re-assertion.
- **macOS** keeps the `file-write*` and `file-link` denies and drops only `file-read*`.

On a host running **unconfined** — no sandbox backend, or `agent.sandbox='off'` with the
`sandbox_allow_no_isolation` opt-in — there is no seal to apply and the argument is inert:
the child has the whole filesystem, so the cache is one of many things it can write, and
singling it out would neither restore the seal nor be the tightest control available. What
bounds a forged cache there is **provenance rather than permissions**: with
`require_policy_signature` set in the admission policy, a document nobody trusted is refused
however it got onto disk — on the boot path, on a 304 revalidation, and in a cache-only child
alike. That is the control to reach for on a host that cannot be sandboxed, and the spawn says
so once: a centrally governed host whose `wrap_argv` was a no-op logs a SECURITY warning naming
that setting.

Refusing to start the app instead would protect nothing. On such a host the backend can rewrite
`security_policy.json`, `admission_policy.json` and the SEL signing key **directly** —
`is_sensitive_path` gates the agent's TOOL CALLS and the other file-access surfaces, not an
arbitrary process's `open()` — so forbidding an app to *read* the ceiling while it can *replace*
the ceiling trades a real capability for no gain. That is also why the answer here is provenance
rather than permissions.

The same `file-write*` deny applies when the cache is hidden outright, because there the
seatbelt rule denies `file-read*` only while the Linux bind blocks both directions. It is
scoped to this directory rather than every entry, because widening the others has its own
blast radius (a write deny on `.aws` would break a legitimate token refresh).

Those dir entries are `$HOME`-relative, so `KIROCREW_HOME` moves the cache out from under
them — a limitation shared with the vault entries. This one directory does not inherit it:
`sandbox._relocated_policy_cache_dirs()` additionally masks the data-home path whenever it
differs. Compared with **`normpath`, not `realpath`**: this runs inside the launcher and
seatbelt builders, which run on the event loop for every async spawn, and a link-resolving
syscall on a stalled NFS home would freeze the gateway and its liveness heartbeat — the same
reason the launcher pushes its `isdir` checks into the child. The cost is one-directional:
where the home is a symlink (`/home/u` → `/local/home/u` is ordinary, and `config_dir()`
resolves links internally) the spellings no longer compare equal, so a default layout reports
as relocated and the resolved path is masked *in addition to* the `$HOME`-relative one. That
is a redundant rule for a directory that must be masked either way, never a missing one — the
comparison was only ever de-duplication.

The sensitive-path entry is asserted by `assert_governance_paths_protected()`, and it is load-bearing for a reason the policy
file's own entry does not cover: the metadata records the **source**, and the loader
honours that record when deciding whether the cache is this host's last-known-good.
An agent able to write here would not need to touch `security_policy.json` to replace
its own ceiling — it would publish itself one, with provenance. Read matters as much
as write: the cache is a verbatim copy of the document the trust-root entry exists to
keep unreadable.

### Refresh loop

A daemon thread (`kc-policy-refresh`), started from `run_gateway` under the same
`if not test_mode` gate as the beacon so the offline E2E gate can never make an
outbound request, and stopped in `_shutdown` with a **0.5s** join budget — it waits
on an `Event`, so an idling refresher wakes immediately, while one mid-fetch must not
eat the `GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_SECS` budget that saves active chat slots.

It **waits one full interval before its first poll**: boot has just established the
ceiling from this same source, so an immediate re-fetch would be a redundant round
trip on every host at startup and, across a fleet restarting together, a thundering
herd against the admin's own endpoint. `refresh_interval_secs` is clamped up to
`MIN_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECS` (60) rather than rejected — refusing would brick a fleet
over a number with a safe reading.

**`refresh_interval_secs: 0` (or omitted) is boot-only, and that binds the loader path
too.** No poller starts, which is the easy half. The subtle half is that
`load_security_policy` is re-run *per app callback* by `mcp_gateway/app_call.py`, and
`_fetch_window` floors a zero interval at 60 s so it never reads as "fetch on every
call" — but a floor is still a cadence, so an operator who asked to freeze the ceiling
for the process lifetime was getting a 60-second poller on that path, one that could
hand an app callback a *loosened* document while the gateway kept the ceiling it booted
on. Once the process has established a central ceiling
(`central_ceiling_installed()`), a boot-only source is served from the cache and never
re-fetched. Boot's own first call still fetches, because nothing is installed yet, and a
boot that degraded without establishing a ceiling retries rather than freezing on one it
never had. `max_cache_age_secs` is a separate bound and still applies, so this is not
"trust bytes of any age", and `refresh_now` does not come through this path — so
`kirocrew policy fetch` stays the operator's explicit lever in this mode.

### Materialised controls, and the one hook that re-derives them

A ceiling swap changes what every LIVE evaluation answers, and most governed controls are
live evaluations: `sandbox.min_level` is re-read per spawn through `governance_floor_ordinal`,
the governance gate runs per tool call. A few are **materialised** once, when an action is
taken, and then outlive the decision — and for those a swap is not enough on its own.

A published tailnet origin is the case that matters. The `capabilities.tailnet_origin` gate
fires when `publish` is *called*; it is a chokepoint on the action, not a condition re-checked
while serving. That was sound while the ceiling could only change at boot. With a live refresh
it is not: a fleet pinning the capability off mid-flight would otherwise leave every
already-published host serving its dashboard on the tailnet until someone restarted it, with
the policy reporting the capability as denied the whole time.

The other case is the agent config's **`allowedTools`**. It is kiro-cli's blanket
auto-approve list, and the five writers of it consult the ceiling when they *write* — after
which kiro-cli reads the FILE. So a ceiling that comes to deny a tool mid-flight does not
narrow a list already on disk, and every session started afterwards keeps auto-approving what
the fleet now forbids: the tool short-circuits inside the harness and never reaches Kiro Crew's
own PreToolUse gate. `agent.reproject_for_ceiling_change` re-derives the file, bounded to an
actual ceiling move by `governance_generation` — hooks run on every confirming poll, so an
unconditional rebuild would rewrite a file kiro-cli watches every refresh interval for nothing.
Two details make that bound safe rather than merely cheap. The baseline is seeded by
`prime_ceiling_projection` **before the poller starts**, because the first poll can itself
install a new ceiling and a first-call baseline would record that generation and skip the very
rebuild it needed. And the memo advances **only after a successful rebuild**: a failure raises
through the hook runner, which logs and moves on, so marking the generation synchronised would
lose the retry the next poll gives and leave forbidden auto-approvals on disk for the process
lifetime. An unseeded baseline rebuilds once rather than skipping — a redundant rewrite costs a
file write, a skipped one costs the tighten.

What no hook can do is narrow a session **already negotiated**: kiro-cli holds the grants it
was given, and nothing reaches into a running one. That limit has the same shape as an
already-running process keeping its own sandbox — a restart is its only answer, which is also
why *removing* live refresh would not close it. What live refresh plus this hook does close is
every session after the tighten, which without it stayed open indefinitely.

`register_post_install_hook` is the seam. Append-only, like `register_policy_fetcher`, and
deliberately unaware of what it calls — this module must not learn about tailnet or anything
above it, so the gateway registers `tailnet_serve.revoke_if_governance_now_pins_off` before
it starts the poller. Hooks run on the refresher thread wherever a poll **confirms** what governs — an install *or*
an `unchanged` result — and best-effort: an exception is logged at ERROR **with a `degraded`
governance incident** and the next hook still runs. The incident is what puts a control the
installed ceiling calls for and the host is not applying onto `security_posture` and the
dashboard, rather than leaving it in a log nobody reads.

It does **not** unwind the install, and that direction is deliberate rather than lazy. Rolling
back would restore the OLD, looser ceiling — strictly less protection than the new one with a
single materialised control stale, since the tightened ceiling still binds every call that
control does not pre-approve. Confirming polls rather than installs alone is what makes the
retry automatic: they are best-effort, so a transient failure (the tailnet daemon busy for one
cycle) would otherwise never be retried — the document does not change, every later poll
returns `unchanged`, and the forbidden control stays materialised until someone restarts the
host. They are cheap and idempotent for it: the tailnet one is a governance evaluation that
returns immediately unless the capability is actually denied, and it asks twice, deliberately.
The first is a **pure read** with no `audit_tool`, because `is_governance_pinned_off`'s own
contract is that auditing a mere inspection appends HMAC-chained SEL rows at a multiple of the
decisions that govern anything. Once there is something to withdraw it asks again **through the
audited seam**, because that is the decision that does something — and an automatic revocation
needs the record more than a human-driven one does: nobody typed it, so the SEL row is the only
place a reviewer can see that the *fleet's policy* took this host off the tailnet. `unpublish`
cannot supply it; withdrawal is deliberately never gated there, so it discards its own
`audit_tool`. One extra evaluation, on the acting path only. The revocation
itself is narrow — it acts only when governance now denies the scope *and* `serve_state`
confirms the handler is ours, so a mapping an operator added by hand is never touched.

**Boot applies the same two gates a refresh does** — the source-migration refusal and
`validate_ceiling` — before it records or caches anything. Otherwise boot would install a
document `refresh_now` refuses, and the refresher would then reject it on every cycle for
the lifetime of the process, logging a rejection forever while the host ran on it. A
refusal here is handled like a parse refusal: salvage from the cache if it can still serve,
else raise. A document read and refused is not an availability failure, so it must not
quietly demote the host onto a lower tier — and it is not cached, so a corrected push is not
shadowed by a poisoned last-known-good.

**A source-less declaration reaches the engine, not just the parser.** Accepting such a block
is only half the job: `_declared_distribution` discarded it for having no `source`, so the
settings were parsed and thrown away. `on_unavailable` is the one that bites — a fleet that
published `degrade` silently got the `fail_closed` default and aborted startup on the first
outage. It is retained whenever `KIROCREW_POLICY_URL` names the address the settings are for,
and `resolve_distribution` overlays the environment onto it, which is what lets the two
channels combine at all. With no address from either channel the tier stays inert.

**Both guards defer to an environment pin.** `resolve_distribution` lets the environment win
per setting precisely so whatever provisions the host owns the address, and two rules had to
learn that. A `distribution` block with settings but no `source` is legitimate when
`KIROCREW_POLICY_URL` supplies one — the ordinary split, where the fleet publishes the cadence
and the staleness bound while the host owns the address — and rejecting it aborted boot on
exactly the configuration the two-channel design intends. And the migration refusal below
only fires when the document's declaration is the one that would actually take effect;
otherwise a canary pinned elsewhere by env would refuse every document the fleet published.

**An unconditional 304 is not success.** `--force` skips the conditional validators
deliberately, so a fetcher that answers "unchanged" anyway has answered nothing — and reporting
that as `unchanged` made `kirocrew policy fetch --force` exit 0 having established nothing, which
is exactly what a config-management run reads as "this host took the change". The loader's own arm
already refused it; the refresh path now does too.

**A live refresh cannot migrate `distribution.source`.** A candidate document that names a
different address is refused rather than installed, because nothing else would notice: the
refresher re-reads the installed ceiling each cycle, so it would start polling the new
address and the migration would look like it worked — until a restart, where the bootstrap
declaration (the environment variable or the placed policy) still names the OLD source and
the cache, recorded against the new one, is discarded by the repoint rule. A fleet that had
retired the old address would then have hosts that run fine and cannot reboot, with nothing
in between to warn them. Migrating a source is a **bootstrap** change: move
`KIROCREW_POLICY_URL` or the placed policy's `distribution.source`, and the new address is
durable at the next boot as well as this one. A document that repeats its own source, or
omits the block, is not a migration and is unaffected.

**A `max_cache_age_secs` the cached document declares for ITSELF is enforced too,
tightest-wins.** The bound is as likely to be set in the published policy as in the
bootstrap declaration — `effective_max_cache_age` already assumes so for the child it
hands the value to — but at boot the resolved `PolicyDistribution` comes from the
environment or a lower tier, so a fleet that set the bound only in its own document had it
applied while the process ran and silently dropped on the next restart: exactly the
restart-during-an-outage case the bound exists for. `_cache_is_too_old` consults both
declarations, and `_cached_max_cache_age` reads the value straight from the cached JSON
because this runs *before* the document has been validated — anything unreadable or not a
positive whole number means "declares no bound of its own", leaving a malformed cache to
be refused by the parse that follows rather than by a staleness pre-check.

It also covers a label passed to code that reports it *elsewhere*, and the split between
the two surfaces is the point. `_audit_policy_signature` puts **which** policy and **why**
in the SEL record — which is on the keystone, so an agent cannot read it — and its
`logger.warning` carries only the state plus a pointer to that record. Neither the label
nor the reason is interpolated into the log line, because the log ring is served by
`GET /api/logs` and the agent's own browser tooling can drive that; the label is whatever
the caller was resolving (for this tier, a URL that may itself be the credential) and the
reason names the issuer the *document* claimed. On top of that,
`parse_distributed_policy` computes one redacted label up front and uses it for the
signature call and for its own error text, so a URL never reaches the audit record either
— rather than teaching the verifier about URLs.

That rule covers **tracebacks, not only messages**: `logger.warning(..., exc_info=True)`
prints the exception's own text, and a parse refusal names the source it refused — which
for a pre-signed URL *is* the credential. So every arm here that logs a
`PlatformCompositionError` logs `_sanitize_detail(str(exc), source)` rather than a
traceback, and the arms that fail before a `dist` exists redact against
`KIROCREW_POLICY_URL` instead. The test reads the FORMATTED traceback rather than
`record.getMessage()`, because the exception text is rendered by the handler — a
message-only assertion would pass while the log ring printed the URL.

**The source URL is emitted nowhere** — not in `RefreshOutcome.detail`, which
`kirocrew policy fetch` prints, and not in a log line either. One rule rather than a
per-surface judgement, because the surfaces are not as separable as they look: the log
ring is served by `GET /api/logs` and rendered in the dashboard, which the agent's own
browser tooling can drive, so "it is only a log line" is not a boundary here. The operator
configured the endpoint and does not need it echoed; the scheme plus the error text is
what diagnoses a failure, and `kirocrew policy source` reports the scheme by design. `_sanitize_detail` also **substitutes the request credential by exact value**, before the
generic pass. `security.redact` recognises credential *shapes*, and
`KIROCREW_POLICY_HEADERS` is deliberately arbitrary — an `X-Fleet-Key` holding an opaque blob
matches no pattern anyone can write, so pattern matching cannot reach it. What makes this
tractable is that the value is not a pattern to us: we sent it, so we can substitute the
string itself, which is strictly stronger than any shape rule for exactly the values at risk.
Values shorter than 8 characters are left alone — not credentials at that length, and
replacing a 1–3 character string would corrupt every message containing those characters.
Longest first, so a value that is a prefix of another does not leave its remainder behind, and
never raising, because a sanitiser that can fail is one that stops sanitising at the worst
moment.

**Every reason this module builds goes through `_sanitize_detail`, not `_redact_source`.**
The difference matters wherever the text includes an exception: `_redact_source` knows only
the *configured* source, while the exception is the ENDPOINT's — an error page, or a proxy
echoing the request back, can carry the `Authorization` header into it, and
`_sanitize_detail` runs `security.redact` over the result as well. Unified even on the arms
that carry no endpoint text, so a later edit that adds some cannot reintroduce the gap. It is
redacted
as a substring (`_redact_source`) rather than by rewording each message, because the
detail is assembled from exceptions raised all over the module and, through the fetcher
seam, from an edition's own transport: a per-message rule is one someone has to remember.
The **hostname alone** is redacted as well as the full URL, since plenty of transport
errors never quote the whole thing — a TLS mismatch says "hostname 'x' doesn't match"
and a DNS failure names the host by itself.

`_sanitize_detail` wraps that in the **shared credential + exfiltration-URL chain**
(`security.redact`), because the source is not the only thing in these messages that
must not be published: a malformed document reaches the text through a parser error, and
`json`'s errors quote the offending bytes — so an endpoint echoing back the request's
`Authorization` header (its own request reflected, a proxy error page) would carry that
credential to both surfaces. Those bytes are not ours, which is why
`platform/policy_distribution.py` is a registered `_REDACTION_SINKS` entry rather than an
allowlisted non-egress use.

`refresh_now()` **never raises**; it returns a `RefreshOutcome` whose `status` is one
of `not_configured` / `unchanged` / `applied` / `rejected` / `unreachable`. Named
states rather than a boolean because the CLI, the viewer and the audit trail all need
to tell "nothing changed" apart from "a push was refused". Only the outcomes that
changed something or failed are audited (`log_governance_decision`, scope
`distribution`) — auditing an unchanged poll would append one HMAC-chained row per
interval per host for a decision that decided nothing — and the record carries the
source's **scheme, not its URL**, because the SEL is readable through surfaces the
agent can reach.

### Signature verification is the same trust root

A fetched document carries `identity.signature` and is verified exactly as a file
tier is, against a trust key in the operator-controlled admission policy — never a
key the fetched document supplies about itself. The opt-in is that policy's
`require_policy_signature`, honoured here like at every other tier; this tier adds no
flag of its own, for the reason above. It is enforced inside
`parse_distributed_policy` as well as at the shared boot gate, so a refused document
never reaches the cache.

**Roll the build before the pin**, the same caveat `updates` carries: the parser fails
closed on an unknown key, so a build predating `distribution` refuses to boot on a
policy that declares one.

### Operator surface

`kirocrew policy source` reports the posture; `kirocrew policy fetch [--force]`
fetches now and applies the result, exiting **non-zero** on a refusal or an
unreachable source so it is usable as a fleet-verification step in a
config-management run. `--force` skips the conditional validators, because a `304`
tells an operator nothing about whether the document they just published reads
correctly. Both inherit the `policy` command's deliberate **non-exposure as an MCP
tool** — it surfaces governance internals the governed subject should not enumerate.

`distribution_posture()` is the read-only projection, carried on
`GET /api/governance/policy` as its `distribution` key (in **both** literals — the
fail-safe branch needs its own, since the frontend reads the key unconditionally).
It reports the source's **scheme and never its URL**, and every value is a number, a
boolean, or a machine-readable enum (`error_code`, `last_refresh_status`) so no
English ships in a JSON body. A fetcher's exception message appears nowhere: it is
prose, and it routinely embeds the endpoint. It reads only the parsed pins, the
on-disk cache and the refresher's in-memory record — **never the network**, because
that GET is browser-triggerable and repolled every 30 seconds. It reads the cache's
metadata only (`read_cache_meta`, which `stat`s the document rather than reading it),
so an open Security tab does not re-read a document of up to `MAX_POLICY_BYTES` every
half minute. The handler's own fail-safe returns an `error_code` rather than a bare
`configured: false`, because the viewer renders the block on
`configured || error_code` and a bare false would hide the row — showing the
reassuring "no enterprise policy in effect" card on a centrally-governed host, the
exact confusion this field exists to remove.

### Bounded re-fetching, and the credential

`load_security_policy` is re-run **per app callback** by `mcp_gateway/app_call.py`, so
the tier bounds itself rather than trusting each caller's discipline: a cache younger
than `_fetch_window` (the fleet's interval, else `MIN_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECS`)
short-circuits without a fetch, and `_claim_fetch_slot` records the **attempt** so a
down endpoint is not retried by every caller. Numeric settings are additionally required
to be **finite** on both channels: NaN parses as a JSON number and every comparison
against it is false, so it would slip past the range and whole-number checks and raise an
uncaught `ValueError` at `int()` instead of a validation error. `refresh_now` — the CLI and the poller —
bypasses the window, because an operator asking for a fetch should get one.

Every `KIROCREW_POLICY_*` variable is on `sandbox._AGENT_DENIED_ENV_KEYS` — not just
the header. `KIROCREW_POLICY_HEADERS` is a live bearer credential, and with it an agent
could read the document the keystone exists to keep it from reading on disk;
`KIROCREW_POLICY_URL` is credential-bearing in its own right whenever the fleet uses a
pre-signed object URL, and even unsigned it names the control plane that the SEL, the
viewer and `RefreshOutcome.detail` all deliberately withhold.

They are listed as **concrete names, not a `KIROCREW_POLICY_` prefix**, because that
list has consumers with two different matching rules: the spawn scrubs use
`startswith`, but `cron_script._CRON_ENV_DENY` tests exact membership and `mcp_cron`
builds `\b`-anchored regexes from it — so a prefix entry silently matches nothing in
either, which is how a bearer token reaches an agent-authored cron script. A test pins
the list against `POLICY_DISTRIBUTION_ENV_VARS` (which owns the set) and separately
drives `_clean_cron_env` to prove the exact-match consumer really drops them.

`apps/backend.py` puts an app backend in **cache-only mode** (`KIROCREW_POLICY_CACHE_ONLY`)
rather than forwarding the source at all. That resolves a real tension instead of picking
a side: forwarding the settings would hand arbitrary third-party code the fleet's control
plane (the header is a live token, and a pre-signed URL is itself the credential), while
forwarding nothing would drop the child to a lower policy tier — a looser ceiling for
exactly the code that most needs one. In cache-only mode the child needs neither, because
the gateway has already written the last-known-good cache: the cache IS the
administrator's ceiling, and the child adopts it with no URL, no token and no network.
The recorded-source check is skipped in that mode, which is sound rather than a
relaxation — there is one cache, the parent wrote it, and the parent applied the repoint
rule when it did. Only `max_cache_age_secs` rides along, because it is the one setting
that decides whether the cached copy is still an acceptable answer — and it is forwarded as
the **effective** value (`effective_max_cache_age()`), not the raw environment variable,
since a fleet is as likely to declare the bound in the published document and reading only
the env would leave the child with no bound at all. In that mode an absent, stale or unusable cache **fails closed**, and the flag is set
only when the gateway's own ceiling came from this tier (`central_ceiling_installed()`).
The two go together: the flag then means "there is a fleet ceiling to inherit", so an
absent cache is not "this host has no central policy" but "the parent had one and could
not pass it on" — which a successful fetch with a failed cache *write* produces. Falling
through there would start arbitrary third-party code under a local or absent ceiling on a
governed host, silently. Gating on the predicate rather than on the variables being set is
what keeps the converse right: a gateway that itself degraded has nothing to pass on, and
flagging that child would refuse to start an app on a host running perfectly well.

`KIROCREW_POLICY_CACHE_ONLY` is also in the tier's **entry** condition in
`load_security_policy`: such a child has no source by design, so gating entry on one would
skip the tier and drop it to a local ceiling — the failure cache-only mode exists to
prevent.

## Policy authenticity (`identity.signature`)

Without a signature check, a policy's integrity rests entirely on **filesystem
permissions** — adequate for the single-user host that owns its own ceiling, but
not for a managed fleet where the operator is not the local user and the local
user can edit the file. `load_security_policy` therefore verifies an optional
detached `identity.signature`, mirroring `admission._signature_valid` rather than
inventing a second scheme.

| Piece | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical payload | `policy_signing_payload()` | Routes through `admission.canonical_signing_bytes` — the **same** sorted-keys/compact-separators/UTF-8 canonicalization `PluginManifest.signing_payload` uses, so the two trust roots cannot drift |
| Primitive | `admission.hmac_signature` | HMAC-SHA256 + `hmac.compare_digest`. POC symmetric; an asymmetric verify swaps in behind the same helper |
| Trust key | admission policy `trust_keys[<issuer>]` | The **existing** operator-controlled key store — one store, not two |
| Opt-in | admission policy `require_policy_signature` | Separate from the plugin-facing `require_signature` |
| Verdict | `GovernanceCeiling.signature_state` | `verified` / `unverified` / `unsigned` / `unchecked` |

**Coverage** is the whole document minus `identity.signature` (a signature cannot
cover itself). `identity.issuer` **is** covered, so a validly-signed policy cannot
be re-labelled as issued by someone else. Signing the raw document rather than a
projection of the parsed ceiling is deliberate: it covers keys *this build does
not know* — a companion-registered scope, a future schema addition — so removing
or editing one is still detected, and it keeps the payload scope-name-agnostic
(adding a scope stays a `SCOPE_CATALOG` data change). Because coverage is
byte-canonical over the *parsed* JSON, re-indenting or reordering keys does not
break a signature while changing any value or key does.

**Why the trust key comes from the admission policy** and not from
`security_policy.json` itself: a document must not be the authority on whether it
has to be authentic. A `require_signature` flag inside the security policy would
be self-referential — an attacker rewriting the policy would simply clear it. The
admission policy is already this package's fleet-controlled trust root, already
carries `trust_keys`, and is already on the `is_sensitive_path` keystone, so the
governance trust root inherits every protection the plugin trust root has.
`_policy_trust_settings()` reads through **`admission.read_policy_trust_root()`**,
a deliberately side-effect-free reader — *not* `load_admission_policy`, which
records the dashboard admission posture and emits a **critical**
`governance_degraded` SEL on an absent policy. That is correct once per process at
boot and wrong here, because `gatewayd` re-loads the security policy **per app
call** (`mcp_gateway/app_call.py`), so reusing the audited loader would flip the
governance indicator to degraded and append a critical audit record on every app
call. It never raises, and on an absent/unreadable admission policy it yields no
keys and a `False` opt-in: an admission-policy problem is already handled loudly
and fail-closed in admission's own domain, and it must not additionally make the
security ceiling unloadable through a second path.

**Advisory by default, fail-closed on opt-in.** With `require_policy_signature`
unset (the default, and the seeded value), an unsigned or unverifiable policy
still loads and still governs — every existing standalone install and every
existing policy file keeps working unchanged, with no key to provision. This is
the compatibility contract: verification adds *reporting*, not a new way for a
working install to stop booting. With the flag set, a non-`verified` verdict
raises `PlatformCompositionError` and **aborts boot** (plus a `failed_closed`
governance-health mark), matching the module's existing fail-closed discipline for
a wrong version, a missing `boot` object, or an unknown governed key.

**Every tier's document is checked; the gate judges the final ceiling.** All four
documents — the fetched document, the env path, the companion bundle and the operator
home file — are verified as they are read, and each parsed
ceiling carries its own `signature_state`. Enforcement is a separate step:
`assert_policy_signature_satisfied` runs once on the **final composed ceiling**, whose
`signature_state` is the **authority's** (`_intersect_ceilings` keeps everything outside
`controls` with the authority). So a subordinate that only tightens is composed in
without its own signature having to verify; what must verify is the document that
governs. When `require_policy_signature` is OFF (the default, and what the `amazon`
edition ships) the verdict is advisory and an unsigned policy still governs, so existing
installs keep working with no key to provision. When it is ON, the final ceiling must
carry a verifying signature or boot aborts.

The companion-bundled tier is **not** exempt: the plugin-admission manifest
signature covers only the manifest fields (`name` / `publisher` / `version` /
`capabilities` — see `admission.PluginManifest.signing_payload`), **not** the bytes
of the packaged `security_policy.json`. So "covered by admission" never actually
protected the resource — a tampered bundled policy would have loaded unchecked. An
edition that opts into `require_policy_signature` therefore signs its bundled policy
like any other governed tier.

And a **missing** policy does not satisfy the requirement: with
`require_policy_signature` ON and no policy present at any tier, boot aborts rather
than returning an ungoverned host — otherwise a mandated-signature fleet that lost
or never shipped its policy file would silently run with no ceiling at all, the
exact failure the flag exists to prevent.

**Load computes the verdict; one gate enforces it.** `_verify_policy_signature`
records each tier's `signature_state` as it loads, and never raises.
`assert_policy_signature_satisfied` is the single enforcement point, called by boot
on the **final composed context** alongside the other governance floor gates. It
rejects both failure shapes: a surviving ceiling whose state is not `verified`, and
no ceiling at all.

The split is what makes tier precedence work. `load_security_policy` composes
central → subordinate (env / companion bundle / operator home) and runs
more than once per boot with different arguments — the core calls it with no `bundled_loader`, a companion
edition re-invokes it with one. A raise inside the loader fires on whichever tier
that particular pass happened to reach, so an enterprise host with an unsigned home
file and a correctly signed companion bundle aborted on the *lower-precedence* tier
the core's pass fell through to, even though the bundle is what the final ceiling
comes from. Only the composed result knows which tier won, so only the composed
result can be judged.

`gatewayd`'s per-app-call reload calls the gate too, on the ceiling that reload
produced, so a policy tampered with *after* boot cannot widen an app callback — boot
verified the original bytes, which says nothing about what the reload just read.

**Residual gap — absence is not decidable in `gatewayd`.** That gate is applied only
when the reload returns a ceiling. The daemon is not the composition process: it
never runs `boot_platform`, so it loads with no `bundled_loader` and cannot see a
companion-bundled ceiling. `None` there is the *normal* result on a bundle-only
enterprise host, not evidence the policy is gone, so refusing on it would deny every
app callback. Deletion is therefore caught at boot but not mid-session; closing that
means handing `gatewayd` the composed ceiling instead of re-reading the file, which
is pre-existing behavior and a separate change.

**A broken trust root reads as no opt-in, on purpose.** An admission file that is
absent, unreadable, or not a JSON object leaves verification advisory rather than
failing closed. That is not a gap: an attacker who can write `admission_policy.json`
is outside this threat model (see below) and would simply set the flag to `false`,
which parses fine — so fail-closing on a *malformed* file would catch only a clumsy
variant of an attack the design already concedes, while turning a non-atomic fleet
push or a hand-edit typo into an unbootable host. Corruption there is a reliability
event: it is logged at WARNING, plugin admission independently fails closed on the
same file, and `kirocrew doctor` reports it. Distinct from a broken FILE: a
well-formed trust root whose `require_policy_signature` is present but not a
real JSON boolean (explicit `null`, `"false"`, `0`) reads fail-closed as
opted-IN — both the enforcement gate and the key store route through the one
strict `admission.AdmissionPolicy.from_dict` reader (#9641).


**Threat model.** This detects **offline / at-rest tampering and substitution** of
a policy file by anyone without the issuer's key: a widened ceiling, a stripped
scope, a swapped file, a policy re-labelled to a different issuer. It does **not**
defend against an attacker who holds the trust key, and it is **not** a
confinement boundary for a local process running as the operator — such a process
can edit the admission policy (clearing the opt-in) as easily as the security
policy. The `is_sensitive_path` keystone remains the control that stops the
*agent* from reaching either file; signing is what makes a fleet-pushed ceiling
tamper-**evident** to the host that loads it. Symmetric HMAC also means the
verifier holds a secret capable of *producing* signatures, so key distribution is
the residual weakness an asymmetric successor removes.

`kirocrew policy show` prints the verdict verbatim
(`GovernanceCeiling.signature_summary()`) so an operator can tell an established
issuer from a decorative one — it previously printed a bare `issuer` that no check
had ever established.

## Boot composition

`build_default_context` (the single chokepoint backing both a real boot and the
lazy `current_context` default) calls `load_security_policy()` and stores the
result in the frozen `PlatformContext.governance` field. `CONTRACT_VERSION`
stays **1** (pinned pre-launch — the companion rebuilds in lockstep, so the
mismatch guard always compares `1 == 1`; see `platform-context.md`). Every
enforcement chokepoint reads `current_context().governance`.

## Self-protection (the keystone)

Under *"secure by default, not by mandate"* there is **no compiled-in floor** —
the entire posture is operator-editable. The only invariant is the
**agent-vs-operator split**: the agent cannot edit the policy/profile files.
This is enforced solely by adding them to `security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`
(`~/.kiro/crew/security_policy.json`, `~/.kiro/crew/profiles`,
`~/.kiro/crew/admission_policy.json`) — `is_sensitive_path` is the shared
read+write gate across every surface. `assert_governance_paths_protected()` is a
boot integrity check that fails closed if a refactor ever drops them.

**`~/.kiro/agents/*.json` and `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` are NOT on the floor
today** — an honest gap worth stating here because it bounds what the ceiling can
claim. Verified on the current tree: `is_sensitive_path("~/.kiro/agents/kirocrew.json")`
is `False` and `echo x > ~/.kiro/agents/kirocrew.json` is not blocked. Since
`hooks.on_tool_call` runs **only** from the `EVENT_PERMISSION_REQUEST` branch (the
`EVENT_TOOL_CALL` branch is documented informational-only — "the tool is already
running (auto-approved by kiro-cli). Hook results cannot block execution"), an
agent that writes itself into `allowedTools` makes kiro-cli stop sending
permission requests and **Plane A never runs at all** for that tool. This affects
every governed capability, not just computer use. Hardening those paths is
deliberately deferred to its own PR (it changes a path floor every legitimate
writer — `agent.py`, `handlers/mcp.py`, `handlers/agents.py`, `apps/backend.py` —
touches, and deserves review on its own merits). Until it lands, a capability
whose only enforcement is Plane A can be skipped this way. Computer use no longer
relies on either plane — it is not governed at all, and rests on the keystone enable
being agent-unwritable. See [computer-use.md](computer-use.md) → "Known limitations".

## Profile resolution + binding

A profile binds to a `surface` (cron/slack/dashboard/subagent/…), an `app` slug,
or a `task` id. `resolve_active_scope(session_key, agent, app)` resolves the
active profile, classifying the session key via `sel._infer_source` (the single
canonical taxonomy parser — never re-implemented). Resolution is:

- **app bind → task/agent bind → surface bind** (most specific first).
- No bound profile on an **attended/proven** surface → `None` (policy alone).
- No bound profile on an **unattended + unproven** surface → `deny_all_profile`
  (fail-closed, never a permissive fall-through), mirroring the dashboard
  `api_session_tool_policy` precedent.

**`identity_proven` is true for ANY non-empty session key**, so an unattended
surface that *does* carry a key — `cron:<job>`, `subagent:<id>`, `taskrunner` —
resolves to `None` (policy-ceiling-only), **not** `deny_all_profile`; only `_bg`
and `_hb` fall to deny-all. That is correct for every scope that remains.

An earlier revision continued: "…and wrong for computer use", and described a
feature-local unattended refusal in `computer_use.gate` plus shipped `cu-off`
profiles bound to the unattended surfaces. **Neither exists.** Computer use is
deliberately ungoverned — no `computer_use*` row in `SCOPE_CATALOG`, no
unattended-surface rule, and no shipped profile of that name — so cron, subagent,
taskrunner, webhook, workflow and channel sessions all drive the desktop once the
operator has flipped the keystone. That is the product decision recorded in
[computer-use.md](computer-use.md); the containment is the keystone the agent cannot
write plus the SEL audit trail, not a surface ceiling. Do not re-document the refusal
without re-implementing it.

**`host` surface (in-process host actions).** A governance check that is not
driven by a user-facing surface — app activation
(`apps.manager._app_activation_denied`), Slack workspace admission
(`slack.enterprise`), non-Slack transport startup
(`slack.gateway._channel_transport_permitted`), and the selectable-ACP-harness
narrowing (`agent_backend_governance.narrow_selectable_backends`) — runs under
the `_host` sentinel session key, which classifies to surface `host`. Operators can bind a
`surface:host` profile to narrow these on top of the policy ceiling (e.g. an
`apps` allowlist that further restricts which apps may activate, or a `channels`
allowlist that narrows which transports may connect below what the ceiling
permits). NOTE: these callers used to pass an empty session key, which
mis-classified to `slack` and accidentally picked up `surface:slack` profiles;
they now use the honest `host` surface, so a `surface:slack` profile no longer
governs host-side app activation or transport startup. The two policy-scope
chokepoints (app activation + transport start) audit their decisions via
`sel().log_governance_decision` (`governance_permits` audits only its own
degrade, never a normal permit/deny); Slack workspace admission audits via a
different sink (`log_api_access`, see below). They also differ on the ERROR
disposition:

- **App activation (`apps.manager._app_activation_denied`)** audits a DENY and,
  on an unexpected governance error, **fails open** (degrades to permit + an
  `audit_governance_degraded` record) — the app's own enable guard still applies
  and wedging host boot on a governance hiccup is worse.
- **Inbound message receive (`messaging.identity.channel_inbound_permitted`)**
  gates each transport's per-message dispatch on the SAME `channels` allowlist,
  resolved on the host surface with `fail_closed=True` and run OFF the event loop
  (it walks the ProfileStore). Called at the top of every dispatcher's
  `handle_message` (Slack / Discord / Telegram / Webex / WeCom — Slack is NOT
  exempt), it closes the gap the connect-time gate alone leaves: a host-profile
  deny added AFTER a transport connected would otherwise keep dispatching inbound
  messages until restart. On deny the message is silently dropped
  (no reply), matching how an unauthorized user is ignored; `PlatformCompositionError`
  propagates. Default OSS build (no `channels` policy) permits, so inbound handling
  is byte-identical to today.
  **Audit disposition:** a GOVERNED allow is audit-or-deny (`critical=True` — a SEL
  persistence failure denies the inbound, so a governed channel never receives
  unaudited); every DENY is recorded best-effort. The **ungoverned default-permit
  is deliberately NOT recorded**: this gate is on the per-message hot path of five
  transports (including observe-mode traffic the bot merely sees), so auditing it
  would append one HMAC-chained SEL row per message on every install with no
  governance configured — hot-path write amplification that also drowns real
  governance signal. Nothing was governed, so there is no decision to record.
- **Transport start (`slack.gateway._channel_transport_permitted`)**
  audits BOTH the allowed and the denied decision and **fails closed**: it passes
  `governance_permits(fail_closed=True)`, and its outer error branch also denies
  (`return False` + `audit_governance_degraded(failed_closed=True)`), so a
  transport connects ONLY on a positive permit. This deliberately DIVERGES from
  app-activation and `mcp_core._vet_channel_governance` (both fail open) because a
  transport is an externally-reachable network surface — deny-by-default on any
  error is the safer posture there, and a transport that fails to start leaks
  nothing. `fail_closed=True` is the same disposition the authorization/admission
  chokepoints use (e.g. `capabilities.publish` in `publish_governance.py`,
  `capabilities.theme_install` in `handlers/themes.py`, `capabilities.theme_persona`
  in `chat_runner.py`) where a wrong permit lets bytes leave the box or ingests
  untrusted content. The ALLOW audit is disposition-split: a **governed** allow
  (a policy/profile governs `channels`, detected as the Decision's
  `layer ∈ {policy, profile, both}`) is **audit-or-deny** — written
  `critical=True` (synchronous + raising) so a SEL persistence failure propagates
  and DENIES the start (the default background writer swallows disk failures, so
  `critical` is required for the guarantee to be real); an **ungoverned** allow
  (no policy governs `channels` — the default OSS build) is **best-effort** so OSS
  transport availability never depends on SEL disk health. The deny audit is
  best-effort (the transport is not starting either way). The governed check keys
  on `layer`, NOT `rule`: `resolve()` returns `rule="rule2-intersect"` for EVERY
  permit — including the case where a policy exists but does not govern
  `channels` — so a `rule != "default"` test would mis-treat that ungoverned case
  as governed; `layer` names which level actually carried the decision
  (`""` = no policy at all, `"default"` = policy present but this scope
  ungoverned, `policy`/`profile`/`both` = governed).
- **Slack workspace admission (`slack.enterprise`)** audits via `log_api_access`
  (not `log_governance_decision`) and its posture probe fails **closed** (returns
  False + `audit_governance_degraded(failed_closed=True)`) on an error, because
  admitting an unverified workspace is the higher-blast-radius mistake.

The Slack posture check itself stays policy-only (a profile cannot carry
`posture`, Rule 6).

Profiles hot-reload via an mtime fingerprint (`ProfileStore`); a schema-invalid
profile falls back to deny-all (Validation rule 5), **not** the ceiling — unless
the policy declares a top-level `fallback` profile (see *Configurable fallback*
below), which is substituted instead. `extends` is monotonic narrowing
(`compose_profiles`).

**Configurable fallback (policy-only).** By default the substitute for an unusable
profile is the most-restrictive deny-all. A policy MAY declare a top-level
`fallback` object — parsed as a narrow-only profile (same scope validation; an
unknown scope in it fails closed at boot, on both sides of the key-open asymmetry
described below, because it is part of the policy document rather than a profile
file) — which the loader substitutes at all
three unusable-file sites instead of deny-all. Intersected with the ceiling like
any profile, it can only narrow it: it lets an operator keep the basic operational
planes available (subagent/cron/heartbeat/taskrunner) while still denying the
sensitive ones (for example `channels`/`apps`) when a profile file cannot be
loaded. Absent the key the fallback stays deny-all (the default is unchanged). A
profile may NOT declare `fallback` (policy-only, rejected at parse). The chosen
fallback is resolved against the composed ceiling, and the profile-store freshness
key folds in whether a fallback is declared, so a store first-touched before the
ceiling composed reloads once it does rather than baking deny-all permanently.

**Unknown `capabilities.*` child in a PROFILE — tolerated ONLY when `enabled: true`.**
An unknown governed key normally fails closed. The one exception is a child of a
*key-open* namespace (`capabilities`) inside a **profile file**, and it is
deliberately **asymmetric**:

- **A payload of exactly `{"enabled": true}` (that one key, boolean identity) →
  tolerated.** `parse_profile` skips it, logs a warning naming the profile and the
  key, and records it on `Profile.unknown_scopes`. Known siblings in the same block
  still parse and still enforce.
- **Anything else → fails closed** exactly as before the tolerance existed
  (`enabled: false`, `enabled` absent, a non-dict value, a non-boolean `enabled`,
  or **any extra key beyond `enabled`** — capability payloads carry inner
  narrowing rulesets like `spawn.agents`, so `{"enabled": true, "agents": {...}}`
  is an enable-plus-narrowing whose narrowing must not be dropped), so the loader
  substitutes the bind-preserving deny-all fallback.

The tolerated side exists because cross-edition data-home sharing is supported: an
edition that `register_scope`s extra capability rows seeds them into `host.json`
with `enabled: true`, and a build without those rows used to reject the whole
profile and degrade the surface to deny-all (every governance row reading "deny
all"). It is safe because a profile is narrow-only and the intersection is applied
by `resolve` (rule-2 intersect of ceiling ∘ profile) — declining to narrow an
unregistered scope cannot change any decision in any build.

The fail-closed side exists because an unknown **narrowing** is indistinguishable
from a typo'd narrowing of a core capability: `{"spwan": {"enabled": false}}` reads
exactly like a failed attempt to disable `spawn`. Tolerating it would silently grant
what the operator tried to deny, so the loud deny-all fallback is the correct
outcome — it surfaces the typo.

**Accepted design consequence.** One residual class is knowingly not caught: a
typo'd capability name that carries `enabled: true` (for example
`{"spwan": {"enabled": true}}`) is tolerated rather than surfaced as an error. This
is inert by the argument above — the declaration could not have changed a decision
whether it was honored or skipped — so the cost is a missed diagnostic, not a
permission change. `Profile.unknown_scopes`, surfaced in the Security page's
governance payload as `unknown_profile_scopes`, is what makes that class visible.

Three things are deliberately unchanged: a **policy** naming an unknown key still
raises regardless of `enabled` (tamper-evidence, Rule 8); the policy's top-level
`fallback` object — parsed as a profile body but not through `parse_profile` — still
fails closed at boot; and an unknown **top-level** governed family in a profile
still fails closed. The tolerance assumes `SCOPE_CATALOG` is **append-only** (a
scope is added or retired, never renamed in place), else a renamed row declared
`enabled: true` would be silently tolerated instead of surfacing as a migration.

**Present-but-unrecoverable profile — governed fleet fails closed, standalone is
lenient.** The reload reads each file's bytes SEPARATELY from parsing and handles
four on-disk states:

- *Parse error with a salvageable bind* (present, readable, but invalid JSON /
  schema, yet the parsed dict carries a valid `bind`): deny-all, binding
  **salvaged from the parsed content** (`_salvage_bind`) so the bound surface
  still resolves to deny-all, not policy-only.
- *Present but unrecoverable* — an `OSError` on `read_text` (bad perms, IO error)
  OR a `UnicodeError`/`UnicodeDecodeError` (invalid encoding) OR a parse error
  with **no** salvageable bind. The file's intended permissions cannot be read, so
  the profile **FAILS CLOSED**: its surface resolves to a **deny-all**, never to
  its last-known-good permissions. This is deliberate — a profile that was just
  *tightened* and then became unreadable must NOT keep its newly-denied operations
  authorized (the fail-open this closes; it also covers a composed child whose
  parent changed). The reload is still per-file (it always publishes the
  successfully-parsed profiles, so a valid *tightening* of any OTHER profile in the
  same reload is still published — no whole-store rollback). To keep the deny-all
  **bound** to its surface (rather than dropping to policy-only, a fail-open of the
  operator's narrowing), the reload recovers the `bind` — from the parsed dict via
  `_salvage_bind` for a parse error, else from the prior snapshot's entry. When
  **no** bind can be recovered (a first-ever unreadable file, no salvageable dict,
  no prior), the disposition splits on whether the fleet is governed:
  - **Governed fleet** (a policy ceiling is present): boot **fails closed** —
    `assert_profiles_within_ceiling` raises `PlatformCompositionError` and aborts
    boot rather than run with a silently-dropped restrictive profile
    (deny-by-default: refuse to run over run-ungoverned).
  - **Standalone / ungoverned** (no ceiling): **lenient** — the file becomes an
    unbound deny-all that drops out of the bind index, so the surface falls to
    policy-only (matches pre-split standalone behavior; a profile blip never
    crashes an ungoverned install). Catching `UnicodeError` alongside `OSError`
    at the read is required: `UnicodeDecodeError` is not an `OSError`, so without
    it a corrupt-encoding file would escape uncaught and crash boot inside
    `assert_profiles_within_ceiling`.
- *Directory unenumerable* — `iterdir()` on the profiles dir raises. ONLY a
  `FileNotFoundError` is the NORMAL "no profiles configured" case (a fresh data
  home): publish an EMPTY index (policy-only), no warning. Every other `OSError`
  — EACCES/EIO on an existing dir, OR `NotADirectoryError` (a non-directory at the
  `profiles` path, a MISCONFIG where honouring "empty" would silently drop all
  Level-2 narrowing) — is treated as present-but-unreadable, NOT benign absence:
  if a prior snapshot exists it is **preserved untouched** (a transient blip must
  not drop every active profile to policy-only); if there is **no** prior (a cold
  boot with an unreadable/non-directory path) the reload flags the whole dir
  unrecoverable so a governed fleet boot-aborts rather than silently running with
  zero profiles. `_dir_fingerprint` maps this to a distinct `<unreadable>`
  sentinel (vs `<absent>` for a genuinely missing dir) so a later fix/delete busts
  the cache.
- *Absent* (missing file, or one that vanished between `iterdir()` and read):
  **not** a policy — skipped, no manufactured deny. An attended/host surface with
  no profile at all legitimately falls to the policy ceiling (policy-only), per
  `resolve_active_scope`.

**Runtime unrecoverable escalation.** `assert_profiles_within_ceiling` is the
boot floor and runs **once** — a live ceiling swap runs
`assert_profile_floor` instead, which is the ordinal half without this refusal
(see [Central distribution](#central-distribution-distribution--policy-only)) — so
a governed host that hot-loads a *new*
unrecoverable profile after boot (no prior entry to recover a bind from) gets an
unbound deny-all that never matches its intended surface — that surface silently
falls to policy-only until the file is fixed. The reload makes this **loud and
observable** rather than locking the fleet down: an `ERROR` log plus a
`mark_governance_incident("unrecoverable_profile", …)` governance-health incident
(surfaced by the dashboard indicator), and only when a ceiling is actually present
(an ungoverned standalone host has no narrowing to lose). A global deny is
deliberately **not** the response: one stray unreadable file must not DoS every
working surface over a narrowing that was never in effect. Boot differs precisely
because no prior state proves the fleet is within its ceiling, so boot aborts.

Fingerprint + recovery: the dir fingerprint is `st_mtime_ns + st_size +
st_ctime_ns` per file (ctime included so a `chmod` that fixes perms — which
changes ctime, not mtime/size — busts the cache). The store **always commits**
the fingerprint after a reload, even one that produced a deny-all for an
unreadable file, so a persistently-unreadable profile does NOT re-run
`iterdir`+`read_text` on every synchronous `resolve_active_scope` (a slow-FS
event-loop wedge). Recovery is the **normal hot-reload path**: because an
unreadable/malformed profile fails CLOSED (a deny-all — there is nothing STALE
being served), the only transition needed is "file fixed", and every realistic fix
(edit, `chmod`, delete, atomic-rename) changes `mtime`/`size`/`ctime` and busts
the fingerprint, so the next resolve reloads. There is **no** same-metadata bounded
retry — that machinery previously existed only to re-read a *preserved* (stale)
entry; with fail-closed there is no stale entry to recover, so it was removed.

Freshness picks its reload discipline from **one** condition — has this store ever
loaded? — not from which thread is calling. `_Snapshot.loaded` records that
distinction, and it is load-bearing: a never-loaded snapshot is EMPTY, and an empty
snapshot is indistinguishable from a genuine "no profiles configured" host, so a
caller served one resolves `profile=None` and `governance_permits` returns its
`ungoverned` **default-permit** — a fail-OPEN that `fail_closed=True` cannot catch,
because the default-permit is a normal return rather than an exception.

`_ensure_fresh` **never blocks** — it takes the reload lock with
`acquire(blocking=False)` only, because it is reachable on the event loop (the
synchronous PreToolUse gate) and waiting there on another thread's filesystem I/O
would wedge the gateway (a slow first profile load in a worker plus a concurrent
dashboard tool approval is exactly that stall). It returns whether the snapshot is
**resolved**, i.e. safe to authorize against, and a caller that loses the lock
does not wait:

- **Warm** (already loaded): serve the current immutable snapshot, resolved
  `True`. Safe because `_snap` is only ever replaced wholesale (an atomic ref
  swap), so a concurrent reader sees a coherent prior-or-next snapshot — and
  because a prior snapshot *exists*, the worst case is authorizing against the
  last committed state for one call; the next access self-heals.
- **Unprimed**: resolved `False`. There is nothing safe to serve, so
  `resolve_active_scope` returns a **deny-all** for that one call (and logs a
  warning) instead of `None`. Concurrent first-touch is the *expected* case, not
  an exotic one: nothing primes the store on the ungoverned / profile-only boot
  path (`assert_profiles_within_ceiling` early-returns when no ceiling is
  present), so a startup burst across the five transports puts several `mc-gov`
  threads on the first load at once. Regression-locked by
  `test_cold_store_contention_never_serves_ungoverned_permit`. Read-only callers
  (the CLI, the boot floor) may ignore the result; the authorization path may not.

A failed first load commits no fingerprint and leaves `loaded` False, so one
transient read error cannot cache a permanent fail-open
(`test_failed_first_load_does_not_cache_a_permissive_state`).

The lock gives the reload transaction a single owner, so concurrent callers don't
each run the full `iterdir`+`read_text` walk and publish competing snapshots. On a
genuine metadata change a warm reload walks the profiles dir exactly **once**: the
warm caller reuses the pre-lock fingerprint it already computed rather than
re-statting under the lock (a second walk on the loop would be a slow-FS stall for
no freshness gain), while an unprimed caller — which has no pre-lock value —
stats once under it. Either way the fingerprint used for the freshness test is the
one committed, so the committed fingerprint always describes the snapshot actually
published.

mtime hot-reload itself is unchanged: an operator edit to a profile is picked up
without a restart. What the store deliberately does **not** have is a per-thread
"always block" discipline for off-loop callers on a **warm** store. There its only
benefit is closing a staleness window one call wide while a reload is concurrently
in flight — not worth a thread-local plus a dual code path, and it invites a future
caller to reach for the blocking path from the event loop, reintroducing the wedge
the non-blocking rule exists to prevent. A surface that needs strict
read-your-writes should add it deliberately, with its own tests.

- **Plane A — the host gate** (`HookManager.on_tool_call`, the primary
  chokepoint). The deny-floor is now the *effective* denied-command rule set —
  the enabled subset of `BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES` ∪ the user's `user_added`
  patterns from the keystone `denied_commands.json` opt-out state, resolved by
  `HookManager._effective_denied(ctx)` and passed to `PolicyAuthority.is_denied`
  as `denied_regexes` (see `security.md`). Gate order: **sensitive-path
  keystone → effective deny-floor (`is_denied`) → `gate_decision(ceiling,
  profile, title)` (governance, incl. the `commands` scope, and MCP titles
  `mcp__server__tool` converted to `@server/tool`) → first-party app-own MCP
  server auto-approve → read-only auto-approve →
  user `auto_approve_tools` loop**. **Canonical MCP identity.** For a call
  carrying BOTH trusted `_meta.kiro` fields, the gate reconstructs
  `mcp__<mcp_server_name>__<mcp_tool_name>` once on the common path and runs the
  deny-floor and `gate_decision` against it **in addition to** the display title
  and raw command — never instead of them. `select_tool_title` prefers the
  model's prose `description`, so an ordinary MCP call whose per-tool rule names
  the real tool would otherwise miss the ceiling and reach interactive approval,
  where a human "allow" runs a policy-denied tool. The two are not competing
  spellings of one fact: the canonical name is the trusted, non-model-authored
  statement of WHICH tool is invoked and is what a per-tool rule matches, while
  the title and raw command carry the path/command/content signals that a tool
  identity does not express. Each covers a security dimension the other cannot,
  so a deny on EITHER denies the call: a `~/.aws/credentials` title still denies
  behind a harmless canonical name, and a denied canonical name still denies
  behind benign prose. **Server-only identity.** When the backend proves the
  server but not the tool (no `_meta.kiro.toolName`, or an uncached permission
  event), `gate_decision` is asked about `mcp__<mcp_server_name>` instead. That
  is a complete question for this plane and only this plane: `mcp_title_to_ref`
  maps it to `@server`, and an `@server` rule is defined to cover every tool
  under that server, so a `deny @github` ceiling binds on a call whose tool
  cannot be named — without it, governance sees only the model-authored title
  and the call reaches a human who can approve a server the policy forbids. It
  is deliberately NOT added to the deny-floor targets: that plane matches raw
  text and operator regexes, where `mcp__<server>` is a different string from
  the canonical identity a rule is written against rather than a broader form of
  it. A server-only identity never satisfies auto-approval. Because this
  enforcement is
  on the common path, the first-party app-own auto-approve below does **not**
  repeat it; what remains load-bearing there is the identity requirement itself
  (an absent `mcp_tool_name` leaves the canonical name empty, so the tool cannot
  be identified and is not auto-approved). A governance deny wins over a user
  auto-approve, and the read-only auto-approve fast-path runs strictly AFTER
  both the deny-floor and `gate_decision`, so a read-only classification can
  never re-admit a denied/governed call. **First-party app-own MCP server
  auto-approve** (`_app_owns_mcp_server` ∧ `_is_first_party_app`) sits
  immediately after `gate_decision`, so a ceiling/profile still denies it: a
  **builtin** app agent calling its OWN app-scoped server (registered
  `<app>:<server>`) is intra-app — the app talking to its own gateway-shipped
  code, not a host surface — and is auto-approved without re-widening any host
  grant, independent of the Normal/Read/Trust tier (that tier governs the HOST
  tools an app may reach, not the app talking to itself). It keys on the trusted,
  non-model-authored `mcp_server_name` (the ACP `_meta.kiro.mcpServerName`), NEVER
  the LLM-authored title: kiro-cli sets that field only for a genuine MCP-served
  call, so a prompt-injected agent that titles a Bash call `mcp__<app>:srv__x`
  carries an empty server name and never matches (fail-closed). Restricted to
  builtins on purpose: only a builtin's server is provably first-party. A
  THIRD-PARTY app's own server is arbitrary installed code whose internals the
  gate cannot see, so its own-server calls are NOT auto-approved here — the OS
  sandbox it runs under and the third-party admission gate bound its behavior,
  not this prompt. **Inside**
  the read-only fast-path the semantic
  `tool_kind` is authoritative and is tested first, as an ALLOW-list: only
  `read`/`fetch` auto-approve, and every other non-empty kind falls through to
  interactive approval before any title-keyed branch (including the computer-use one)
  is consulted — the title is the agent-authored `description`, and `tool_kind`
  itself is a verbatim ACP string, so a denylist of mutating kinds cannot be
  complete. See `security.md`, "Read-only auto-approve". The governance `commands` deny is
  evaluated in `gate_decision` **independently of** the user's keystone
  opt-out state, so a rule the operator disabled in `denied_commands.json` is
  STILL denied when the enterprise ceiling pins the equivalent pattern —
  tightest-wins. The call sites thread `session_key`/`agent` (they default to
  `""`, so non-governed callers are unaffected).
- **Plane B — kiro agent JSON**: out of scope (v1). KiroCrew no longer writes
  `deniedCommands` into `~/.kiro/agents/*.json` at all — the
  `agent._enforce_denied_commands` injection path is retired — so the hooks gate
  is the SOLE denied-command enforcement point, not a secondary layer. The gate
  is authoritative; KiroCrew does not regenerate `~/.kiro/agents/*.json`.
- **Plane C — out-of-band executors**: the cron `command` (runs via `sh -c`
  outside the ACP flow) is gated in `mcp_cron._vet_command_governance`; the
  cron *capability* on/off gate in `mcp_cron._vet_cron_capability_governance`.
  Both run at `cron_add` (authoring) AND again at fire time — for EVERY job
  kind — via the shared `mcp_cron.vet_job_at_fire_time(job)` entry point
  called from `slack.gateway._cron_callback` immediately before execution:
  `command` jobs re-run the capability gate + the `commands` ceiling, `script`
  jobs re-run the capability gate + the script-body scan
  (`mcp_cron._vet_script_file`) on the freshly re-resolved path (so a script
  file edited on disk after authoring is re-checked too), and `message` (LLM)
  jobs re-run the capability gate before the session dispatch. A policy
  tightened after a job was scheduled therefore denies that job's next run
  instead of only affecting jobs authored after the change. Denial at
  fire time marks the run `last_status="error"`, emits a SEL
  `outcome="denied"` event keyed `cron:<job.id>`, and does not delete or pause
  a RECURRING job — deliberately including the consecutive-failure auto-pause
  counter, which a policy denial must not feed (five denied fires would
  otherwise auto-pause the job permanently) — so a later policy loosening
  lets it resume on its own at its next slot. A denied one-shot `at` job is
  parked DISABLED instead (never deleted, even with `delete_after_run`): its
  due time has passed, so leaving it enabled would refire it on every timer
  tick; the operator re-enables it after loosening; the sandbox
  ordinal floor is clamped in `sandbox.wrap_argv`;
  spawn in `subagent._vet_spawn_governance`; outbound messaging in
  `mcp_core._vet_messaging_governance` plus the per-transport `channels` check
  in `mcp_core._vet_channel_governance`; dashboard cross-surface mirror creation
  in `dashboard.chat_mirror` reuses the fail-closed
  `dashboard.chat_runner._resolve_channel_target` ladder before opaque target
  resolution and at every outbound send boundary (the pre-resolve call carries
  `check_recipient=False` — its link holds the `user:<id>` configured-target
  spelling, which a recipient predicate over conversation ids can never match —
  and the handler re-decides recipient authorization against the resolved
  conversation id, SEL-audited, immediately after; the `channels` governance
  decision itself always precedes the resolve's network side effect); the per-transport **startup** gate in
  `slack.gateway._channel_transport_permitted` (a `channels` deny for a member
  keeps that transport — `slack`/`wecom`/`telegram`/`discord`/`webex` — from
  connecting at boot; resolved under `session_key=HOST_SESSION_KEY` so a
  `surface:host` profile can narrow it; the decisions are computed in an executor
  before any client starts, since the profile-file read is blocking and this runs
  on the gateway loop. **Slack is gated too**, in `_connect_slack` rather than in
  `_start_channel_transports`, because it owns its own socket-client lifecycle: a
  deny must DROP that client, not just skip a start call, so nothing can reconnect
  it later);
  durable memory writes in
  `mcp_core._vet_memory_writes_governance` (at `learn_add`); script-hook
  execution in `hooks._script_hooks_capability_denied` (at `run_script_hook`);
  app activation in `apps.manager._app_activation_denied` (at `enable_app`).

Plane A carries **no live ordinal clamp**. It used to: a computer-use title under a
`computer_use.approval: interactive` floor had both auto-approve branches suppressed,
so the call fell through to interactive approval. That row and its clamp were removed
along with the rest of the computer-use governance model — see [Computer use is NOT
governed](#computer-use-is-not-governed-deliberately). The global `approval_mode`
row's live clamp remains reserved (see "Still-reserved in v1").

### Owner capability previews

`sanitize_agent_config_governance(config, audit=False)` uses the same approval
filter as publication without emitting withdrawal logs or SEL events. The
nested MCP filter receives the same flag. All existing writers keep the default
`audit=True`. Capability previews do not maintain a second governance predicate.
Derived native permissions are updated from the filtered allowedTools list;
custom permission policies that cannot be reconciled without changing their
meaning are refused rather than silently retained as an alternate shortcut.

## Foreign-agent import interaction

Foreign-agent import is a data-ingest path, not a third governance level and
not a trusted configuration source. The governing equation remains:

`effective = POLICY ∩ PROFILE`

Import can only narrow its own selectable data projection; it cannot widen what
either level permits. In particular:

- Foreign security policies, profiles, denied-command state, approval/sandbox
  settings, credentials, hooks, native personas/agents, raw instructions, and
  runtime state are never imported.
- The strict settings allowlist excludes governance and security controls.
  Preserving an existing KiroCrew value on collision cannot be overridden by
  foreign precedence.
- Imported workspace references grant no filesystem permission. Any later tool
  use is evaluated by the ordinary filesystem scopes and sensitive-path
  keystone.
- Imported MCP definitions grant no MCP capability. Managed servers remain
  protected, and later calls still pass the effective `mcp`/`tools` gates.
- Imported memory/skills and closed ConversationLog sessions are passive data;
  provenance records are deduplication evidence, never authorization evidence.
- Imported schedules are created disabled. A later explicit resume uses the
  normal cron capability, command, channel, sandbox, and bound-profile
  chokepoints.

The importer must not write the policy/profile/admission trust-root files or
construct an alternate evaluator. Unsupported or policy-incompatible items are
reported/skipped; import success never implies a governance grant.

### `vet_and_audit` — the audited-decision seam for governed outbound messaging

`governance_profiles.vet_and_audit(scope, item, *, session_key, tool_name,
app="", fail_closed=False, log_warning=True)` evaluates ONE permission
decision via `governance_permits` AND writes its SEL
`log_governance_decision` record — **grant and denial alike** — from a
single code path, then returns the Decision. Any chokepoint whose outcome
must land in the audit trail with a consistent shape calls this seam
instead of pairing `governance_permits` with hand-rolled SEL writes.
Current caller: `mcp_core._vet_messaging_governance` (governed outbound
messaging, shared by `send_message` and `send_notification`, single
`capabilities.messaging` check). Contract details: `fail_closed` passes
through to `governance_permits` unchanged (a degraded evaluation returns a
denying Decision instead of raising); exceptions from evaluation propagate
to the caller so each site keeps its documented degrade posture; SEL write
failures never raise (best-effort audit must not block or unblock the
send). **A new governed caller MUST use this seam** — hand-rolling
`governance_permits` + SEL at a new outbound-messaging chokepoint (e.g. a
future notification delivery-routing fanout) reissues the
record-shape/fail-closed drift this seam exists to prevent.

### Filesystem + egress at the host gate (tool kind + real args)

`filesystem.read` / `filesystem.write` / `network.egress` are enforced at the
**host gate** (`HookManager.on_tool_call` → `gate_decision`), not at a separate
per-call chokepoint, because every tool call already passes through that gate on
every surface. The display *title* is backend-variable and cannot reliably carry
a path or URL, so these scopes are resolved from the tool's **semantic kind +
real arguments** the ACP event carries:

- A `Reading <path>` title classifies to `filesystem.read` (the read path is in
  the title); `classify_tool_args` also maps `tool_kind == "read"` +
  `raw_params["path"]` → `filesystem.read`.
- `tool_kind == "edit"` + `raw_params["path"]` → `filesystem.write`.
- `tool_kind == "fetch"` + `raw_params["url"]` → `network.egress` (the host is
  extracted from the URL so the `host` matcher applies).

`on_tool_call(..., tool_kind=, raw_params=)` carries these from the ACP event
(`AcpEvent.tool_kind` / `.raw_tool_params`); the call sites thread them
(`llm_helpers`, `subagent`, `task_executor`, `task_planner`, dashboard
`chat_runner`, slack `handler`). **The `EVENT_PERMISSION_REQUEST` event the gate
runs on must carry `raw_tool_params`** — `acp/client.py` caches the structured
rawInput at the ToolCall notification (`_tool_call_params`, keyed by
`toolCallId`) and attaches it to the later permission event, because that
message itself carries only a truncated title. Without this the two arg-derived
scopes would be inert in production.

The `kind` field is **spec-optional**: some ACP backends omit it (it arrives
`""`). `classify_tool_args` therefore falls back to the param SHAPE when the kind
is unknown — a `url` (and no shell `command`) → egress; a `path` (and no
`command`) → BOTH `filesystem.read` and `filesystem.write` (it cannot tell read
from write without the kind, so it applies both ceilings; an ungoverned one
permits, and a `command` param routes to the `commands` scope, never filesystem).

This keeps the existing always-on `is_sensitive_path` keystone (the fixed
credential/trust-root block) in force regardless — **and extends it**: the gate
now runs `is_sensitive_path` on the real `raw_params['path']` too, so an edit to
`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, or the governance trust-root files is blocked even when the
display title hides the path. The per-policy path/host rulesets compose **on
top** of this keystone.

> **`folders.*` vs `filesystem.*`.** The profile `folders.read`/`folders.write`
> are **aliases** of the policy `filesystem.read`/`filesystem.write` path scopes
> (the profile schema names them `folders`; the policy names them `filesystem`).
> They are normalized to `filesystem.*` at parse time (`_SCOPE_ALIASES`), so a
> profile's `folders.write` actually narrows the `filesystem.write` ceiling the
> gate queries (both present in one file → intersect). Without the alias they
> would land in separate control keys and silently fail to compose.

### Channels posture (per-transport identity ceiling)

`channels.posture.slack.allowed_enterprise_ids` (policy-only) is enforced in
`slack.enterprise.validate_enterprise`: a workspace must satisfy the governance
posture in ADDITION to the operator's `config.json`
`slack.allowed_enterprise_ids`. The posture is the **agent-unweakenable**
ceiling (the config allowlist is operator-editable; the policy posture is not).
Default-open when no policy posture is configured.

An **empty** id is fail-closed against a *pinned* leaf: Slack returns
`enterprise_id=""` for every non-Enterprise-Grid workspace, and an empty id
cannot satisfy an explicitly-configured allowlist, so it must be DENIED rather
than skipped. `_governance_posture_permits_workspace` distinguishes "leaf is
pinned" from "id is provided" by probing the posture with a sentinel value no
real id can equal: if the leaf is an allow-mode allowlist the sentinel is denied
(pinned → close), otherwise it permits (unpinned → the empty id is fine).

### Channels governance-status surface (read-only) + Settings greying

`GET /api/governance/channels` (`handlers_system.api_governance_channels`,
registered in `dashboard/routes/system.py`, behind the same dashboard token auth as the
sibling `/api/*` GETs) returns the effective per-channel `channels` policy
decision as a `{channel_type: bool | null}` map (`true` = permitted, `false` =
denied by policy, `null` = governance evaluation transiently FAILED → the UI shows
"policy status unavailable", NOT "Off by admin"), e.g. `{"slack": true, "discord":
false, "telegram": false, "webex": false, "wecom": false}`. It calls
`governance_permits("channels", <member>, session_key=HOST_SESSION_KEY,
fail_closed=True)` per member, reading `Decision.permitted`
(default-missing-to-`False`); a fail-closed **evaluation-error** Decision (marked
by `rule == "default"` + a "governance error" reason) is surfaced as `null` rather
than `false`, so a transient failure is never mislabeled as an explicit admin
denial. The offload runs on the dedicated `governance_executor` (browser-
triggerable profile-store I/O must not pin the default DNS pool). This mirrors the **connect-time
host-transport gate** (`slack.gateway._channel_transport_permitted`), which uses
the same `_host` surface and also fails closed — so the viewer agrees with what
the gateway actually started. It is deliberately NOT the same surface as the
**outbound** messaging chokepoint (`mcp_core._vet_channel_governance`): that
chokepoint resolves the CALLER's session and app profile, so its per-send
decision is caller-specific and can differ from this host-surface snapshot (a
narrower app/task profile may deny an outbound send on a channel the host is
otherwise permitted to run). The members are derived from
each transport's `channel_type` class attribute
(`handlers_system._channel_members()`: Slack / Discord / Telegram / Webex /
WeCom), never a hardcoded divergent list. The per-member evaluation runs in a
thread-pool executor (`run_in_executor`) because `governance_permits` can read
profile files off disk — the aiohttp event loop is never blocked.

Read-only and byte-identical by default: with NO policy governing `channels`
(the standard OSS build) `governance_permits` returns `permitted=True` for every
member, so the endpoint returns all-true and the Settings UI is unchanged (every
channel tab fully enabled).

The dashboard Settings UI consumes this map to make the channel tabs
governance-aware: in the single Channels tab (`ChannelsPanel`, a list-detail
view), a policy-denied channel's list row shows an **"Off by admin" chip (greyed,
NOT hidden)** and its detail pane renders a disabled-by-policy state (lock icon +
explanation) instead of the editable bot-token form — so a user isn't confused by
a form that silently does nothing, and cannot save config that would never take
effect. **Slack is governed like every other channel** (it is NOT exempt): its
inbound message + tool-approval + review-action + OPTIONS-choice chokepoints call
`channel_inbound_permitted("slack")`, so a `channels` policy denying `slack`
blocks it and the row is marked "Off by admin" to match. (The connection-time gate
+ the direct cron/heartbeat outbound posts are a separate follow-up; outbound
sends via the messaging tool already pass `_vet_channel_governance`. The non-Slack
transports are additionally gated at connect time by
`slack.gateway._channel_transport_permitted`.) Default OSS build (no policy) →
every channel permitted → nothing greyed.

**Gate placement — BEFORE side effects, not just before the turn.** The inbound
gate for the native Slack path lives in `slack.events._route_message`, placed
right after the auth / interceptor / activation-off checks and BEFORE the first
observable side effect: display-name lookups, audio transcription, image/file
download, `channel_history.push` (denied content must never be recorded — a later
ALLOWED turn in the channel could otherwise pull it into agent context), the
`!restart` bang alias (a gateway restart), and session queueing/dispatch.
`handle_message` keeps its own gate as defense-in-depth for its OTHER entry points
(interaction re-dispatch, synthetic sends). **`!stop` (cancellation) is the sole
exemption** — a denied channel must still be able to halt a runaway session it
previously started; `!restart` is NOT cancellation and stays gated.

The exemption is **channel-neutral**, not Slack-only. `messaging/dispatch.py`'s
`inbound_permitted(channel_type, *, text, has_attachments)` carries it for every
channel on the shared pipeline, via `is_pure_cancel()`. Two properties make it
safe to state that broadly. The match is whole-message, so `/stop the presses`
is an ordinary sentence rather than a cancel, and an ATTACHMENT-bearing message
is never exempt: a channel that fetches media after authorization would
otherwise let a denied channel trigger a download by attaching a file to the one
word that skips the gate. Both arguments default to the gated behaviour, so a
caller that does not pass them is unchanged. This matters most where the channel
has no widgets: with `max_buttons=0` a typed `/stop` is the only cancel
affordance the operator has.

`_CANCEL_ALIASES` is the recognised set, and it is a MIRROR of the per-channel
command tables (`/stop`, `/cancel`, Discord's `!` bang forms, WeCom's `停止`),
which is the one thing about this exemption that has actually gone wrong: WeCom
shipped `停止` in its own table and on its `/help` card while the shared set knew
only the ASCII spellings, leaving a denied WeCom conversation with no reachable
off-switch in the language that channel exists for. Deriving the union in
`messaging/` would invert the dependency — the shared layer importing all nine
channel packages — so the tripwire is a test
(`test_messaging_dispatch.py::test_the_shared_set_covers_the_channel_command_tables`)
which DISCOVERS the channel tables by walking the packages, checks both
directions (an alias no channel accepts is an exemption granted to a dead word),
and fails on a table shape it cannot parse rather than skipping it. An earlier
version named Discord and Telegram by hand and was blind to the three channels
that diverged, which is the same mirror one level up. The OPTIONS
Send / legacy-choice buttons are gated at dispatch BEFORE they edit/post the
selection to the channel (their re-dispatched turn is gated too, but the message
edit precedes it); the spent-marker `_done_` no-op posts nothing and stays exempt.

**Tool-approval REJECT is honored, not dropped.** A `channels` deny blocks
APPROVE/TRUST presses outright, but an explicit REJECT press (Slack transport +
native `reject_tool`, Discord `a:…:0`, Telegram `a:…:0`) is allowed through to
RESOLVE the pending approval as refused (`False`). A reject is itself a denial —
exactly what the policy wants — and silently dropping it would strand the kiro-cli
approval future until it times out (~300s) with the tool neither run nor cleanly
refused. So a blocked APPROVE on a governed-off channel also resolves the future
as denied (prompt refusal) rather than returning without resolving.

### Governance policy viewer (`GET /api/governance/policy`)

`GET /api/governance/policy` (`handlers/security.build_governance_policy_snapshot`,
registered in `dashboard/routes/system.py`, same dashboard-token auth) returns the
effective ceiling across ALL scopes on the **host surface**, for the read-only
Settings → Security viewer. It iterates `SCOPE_CATALOG` (so it auto-covers any
scope a release or the companion registers), intersects each boot-frozen POLICY
control with the host-surface PROFILE control using the model's own
`_compose_controls`, and reports
`{scope, archetype, governed, source, scope_note, detail}` per scope plus
`{version, has_policy, profile, surface, other_bound_surfaces, fallback_profiles,
unknown_profile_scopes, distribution, unavailable}`.

**A row describes ONE surface, and must say which.** The host profile governs
in-process host actions, so it legitimately pins capabilities the host process
never performs — `cron`, `messaging`, `spawn` — OFF, while the surfaces that do
perform them enable them under their own profiles. Rendering such a row as an
unqualified "disabled by policy" therefore reports a *working* feature as
switched off. Two fields keep that honest:

- **`scope_note`** — `host_profile` when the host-surface profile contributes to
  the row (`source` of `profile` or `policy+profile`), so the value is that one
  surface's posture; `policy_wide` when POLICY alone governs, which does apply to
  every surface; `""` when ungoverned. A string enum, not a rendered sentence, so
  the frontend maps it to a translated string and no English ships in a JSON body.
- **`other_bound_surfaces`** — surface ids other than `host` that carry their own
  bound profile (from `governance_profiles.bound_surfaces()`). **Names only**, no
  control, count, or rule from those profiles, so the POSTURE-only boundary below
  is unchanged. This answers the question a host-scoped row provokes: *is cron
  really off, or is that just the host's ceiling?*
- **`fallback_profiles`** — file stems of every profile currently replaced by the
  fallback built-in — deny-all by default, or the policy's declared `fallback`
  profile (from `governance_profiles.fallback_profile_names()`), sorted.
  **Names only**, same exposure contract as `other_bound_surfaces`: a stem is not
  rule content, so the POSTURE-only boundary is unchanged. `_reload` substitutes
  that built-in at three sites — a present-but-unreadable file, a file whose JSON
  or schema does not parse, and a file that parses but `extends` a parent that is
  missing or chained — and enforcement is correct in all three. What is NOT correct
  without this field is the *display*: the substitute reports `source: "profile"`,
  so an unusable file renders identically to a deliberate operator lockdown, and an
  operator has to read server logs to tell them apart.

  Reported as the whole SET rather than a flag for the host-resolved profile, for
  two reasons. A bound non-host profile deny-alls its own surface just as silently
  while appearing in `other_bound_surfaces` looking healthy. And a flag derived by
  matching a resolved profile's declared `name` against file stems mislabels a
  profile whose name collides with a broken sibling's stem, whereas these ARE the
  stems.

  One documented gap: a first-ever load of an unreadable file has no salvageable
  bind, so it is an UNBOUND deny-all. Its stem appears here, but no surface
  resolves to it — that surface falls back to the ceiling rather than being denied.

**Posture, not contents (security boundary).** The serialized `detail` carries
only POSTURE — set `mode`, entry COUNTS (`allow_count`/`deny_count`),
capability `enabled` + inner scope names, ordinal `floor` — and NEVER the rule
CONTENTS (the allow/deny globs, command patterns). This is deliberate: the
dashboard is reachable by the agent's own browser tooling (`playwright-cli attach
--extension` drives the user's authenticated Chrome), and `security_policy.json` /
`profiles` are on the `is_sensitive_path` keystone precisely so the agent cannot
read the ceiling it is fenced by — knowing the exact deny patterns is what would
let it craft an evasion. The human operator reads the authoritative contents from
the policy files directly (outside the sandbox); the viewer shows only which
scopes are governed and how strict they are. The snapshot is **host-surface
scoped** — narrower profiles bound to a specific surface/app/task can tighten a
scope further at runtime, which the viewer states explicitly. Fail-SAFE for
DISPLAY: any resolution error yields a well-formed `unavailable: true` response
(the frontend also treats a fetch error as unavailable) rather than raising or
mislabeling the ceiling as absent — enforcement is server-side and unaffected.

### Audit

Every new chokepoint denial emits a `governance_decision` SEL record (file-
backed, so safe even in the stdio MCP server) via `log_governance_decision`,
matching the host-gate deny path — so cron/script-hook/memory/channel/app
denials leave the same forensic trail.

### Scope boundaries (documented, not gaps)

- **`network.egress` governs the dedicated fetch tool only.** A `fetch`
  tool-kind call is classified to `network.egress` by host. Command-driven
  egress (`curl`/`wget`/`nc` inside a Bash tool) arrives as `tool_kind ==
  "execute"` and is governed by the **`commands`** scope (the command body),
  not `network.egress` — a policy that wants to bound shell egress denies the
  relevant `commands` patterns. This is the same plane split the rest of the
  model uses (a shell command is a `commands` item, never re-parsed into its
  sub-effects).
  [`docs/guides/assets/security-policy.example.json`](../../guides/assets/security-policy.example.json)
  shows both scopes set together, but read it as **egress defense-in-depth,
  not a bounded egress guarantee**: a `commands` deny list is a finite set of
  known patterns, not an allow-shaped ceiling, so it cannot enumerate every
  network-capable tool (`python`, `ssh`, `git`, `pip`, `openssl s_client`, a
  `curl` invocation with no `://` in it, or a piped/absolute-path
  invocation of any of the above), and it says nothing about the web terminal
  PTY, which is an ungoverned plane by design (see below). A deployment that
  needs an actual bound on where the host can reach should treat the example
  as a starting point for defense-in-depth, not as sufficient on its own.
  Separately: once a `commands` deny pattern is adopted into policy, it
  becomes a force-pin via `resolve_pinned_commands` (ceiling pins ∪ profile
  pins, union not override) — a user cannot locally opt out of a pinned rule
  the way they can an unpinned one, so an operator copying the example should
  expect its deny rows to be effectively permanent for anyone bound by that
  policy, not something end users can narrow per-rule.
- **Per-app profile binding via MCP chokepoints is best-effort.** The managed
  `kirocrew-core` MCP server is spawned by kiro-cli, not by an app backend, so
  `KIROCREW_APP_NAME` is absent there — `learn_add`/`send_message` resolve the
  per-SURFACE profile + policy ceiling (the enforced path), not a per-app
  profile. An app's own in-process tool calls (which carry `KIROCREW_APP_NAME`)
  do bind a per-app profile. App blast-radius is contained today by the `apps`
  activation allowlist + per-surface profiles.
- **Shell GUI automation is a `commands` item, never re-parsed.** `osascript`,
  `cliclick`, `xdotool`, `ydotool`, `wtype`, `screencapture`, `scrot`, `grim`,
  `import -window` and `nircmd` inside a Bash tool are governed by the
  **`commands`** scope on the command body — no `computer_use.*` scope applies to
  them, because a shell command is never decomposed into its GUI sub-effects. A
  fleet banning computer use must also deny those `commands` patterns (see the
  copy-pasteable fleet-ban policy below); a deny-mode `commands` pattern also
  becomes an un-opt-out-able force-pin via `resolve_pinned_commands`.
- **The web terminal PTY is an ungoverned plane today.**
  `dashboard/handlers/terminal.py` spawns a real PTY and contains **no**
  `is_denied` / `is_sensitive_bash_command` / governance call, so
  `screencapture` typed into it is bounded by neither the `commands` scope nor
  any `computer_use.*` scope. It is an operator-only surface. Routing PTY input
  through the same effective-deny floor as `on_tool_call` is tracked as its own
  follow-up; do not describe computer-use governance as covering it.
- **Raster capture has two channels and neither is governed.** Computer use has no
  `observations` scope any more, and `playwright-cli screenshot` is a shell command
  rather than a tool call, so an `mcp` deny cannot reach it at all. A fleet that
  means "no raster capture" must deny `@kirocrew-computer` via the `mcp` scope
  **and** the browser CLI via the `commands` scope.
- **The `mcp`-scope deny is now the ONLY governance lever over computer use, and it
  is keyed on a renameable alias.** `mcp.deny: ["@kirocrew-computer"]` works on
  unmodified shipped code, but the server key is derived by `mcp_server_alias()` from
  an agent-mutable config: verified `mcp__kirocrew-computer2__click` and
  `mcp__cu__click` both PERMIT under that deny. With the `capabilities.computer_use`
  row removed there is no authoritative ban behind it — a fleet that must guarantee
  the feature is off should not ship the keystone enable, and should treat the alias
  deny as best-effort. See [Computer use is NOT
  governed](#computer-use-is-not-governed-deliberately).
- **Cursor Motion has no governance row, and deliberately gets none.** The
  fake-cursor desktop overlay (`computer_use/overlay*.py`) grants the agent
  *nothing*: it draws an image, it does not move the pointer, it cannot deliver
  input, and it is invisible to `screencapture` so it cannot even alter what the
  model reads. It is a `config.json` display preference
  (`computer_use.cursor_motion`, default OFF), and adding a scope for it would
  imply an authorization decision where there is no capability to authorize.
  The real pointer path (`click_method: "global"`, which warps the operator's
  physical cursor) has no row either — it is reachable whenever the feature is on,
  and is audited under its own SEL `tool_kind` rather than gated.
- **`kirocrew computer call` is subject to the same checks as an agent call.** The
  CLI harness routes through the same `computer_use.tools.dispatch_tool` chokepoint,
  so the keystone enable and the target policy apply to it, bound to the attended
  `cli` surface (session key `cli_chat`). There is nothing governance-side left for a
  policy author to bind to it.
- **`approval_mode`** — the ordinal is parsed and **boot-floor-checked** (a
  profile looser than the policy mark aborts boot, like `sandbox.min_level`), but
  no approval chokepoint clamps the *live* approval pipeline through it yet: the
  live approval vocabulary (`""`/`auto` in cron; the dashboard trust toggles) is
  not yet reconciled onto the `yolo < auto < interactive` scale. The boot floor
  is the enforced half; the live clamp is the reserved half. Wiring it is the one
  genuinely-architectural follow-up (a single approval-policy resolution point
  fed by `governance_floor_ordinal("approval_mode")`).

  There is no longer a second, live-clamped `approval` row to contrast this with:
  `computer_use.approval` was removed with the rest of the computer-use governance
  model, so `approval_mode` is once again the only row on the `approval` scale and
  its live clamp is still the reserved half.
- **Windows has no machine-policy managed tier today, so the central ceiling is
  advisory against a local account.** There is no machine-scoped policy pin on
  Windows, so `resolve_distribution`
  ([`src/kiro_crew/platform/policy_distribution.py`](../../../src/kiro_crew/platform/policy_distribution.py))
  lets a per-setting environment override stand: a standard user can set the
  `KIROCREW_POLICY_URL` environment variable to a document of their own and
  replace the whole central rung. Read the Windows guidance accordingly —
  central distribution is the **recommended substitute, not a guarantee** that a
  person using the laptop cannot loosen the ceiling. The intended machine-policy
  managed tier (an `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies` registry rung read via `winreg`,
  which an environment variable cannot redirect) is design-of-record, not
  shipped; see [the central-governance-ceiling
  RFC](../../request-for-change/rfc-central-governance-ceiling.md) for that step.
- **macOS has no machine-policy managed tier today either, and the intended design
  reads only a Computer-Level / device-channel managed profile as the machine
  rung.** No managed-profile reader exists on main; see [the
  central-governance-ceiling
  RFC](../../request-for-change/rfc-central-governance-ceiling.md) for that step —
  it is design-of-record, not shipped. The design calls for a managed profile to be
  deployed at Computer Level (Jamf) or through the device channel (Intune) to be
  read as the machine tier. A profile deployed at Jamf **User Level** or through
  Intune's **user channel** would land at a per-user path and would **not** be read
  as the machine tier, so once built the host would govern from a local tier
  without raising an error — the same silent-fallback shape as the Windows
  advisory case above. Whether a user-level profile should be deliberately
  ignored or read as a lower-than-machine rung is an open design question tracked
  in that RFC.

The **enforced** scopes in v1 are: `tools`, `mcp`, `commands` (host gate + cron
command body + the enterprise force-pin for built-in denied-command rules, see
below), `filesystem.read` / `filesystem.write` / `folders.*` and
`network.egress` (host gate via tool kind + args), `channels` (per-transport at
the messaging chokepoint AND at non-Slack transport startup), `apps` (app
activation), `agent_backend` (which ACP harness a deployment may select —
materialised by narrowing the `acp_backends` registry at boot and on every
runtime ceiling install, see below), `sandbox.min_level` (ordinal
floor at `wrap_argv`), `approval_mode` (boot floor only), and every capability
gate — `capabilities.spawn`, `capabilities.messaging`, `capabilities.cron`,
`capabilities.memory_writes`, `capabilities.script_hooks`,
`capabilities.browse` (the native `browser` MCP tool's dispatch chokepoint —
default on; a deny makes the tool refuse outright, and it does NOT fall back to
`playwright-cli`. The `playwright-cli` fallback path itself remains governed by
the `commands` scope, so denying browsing wholesale means denying both this
capability AND the `playwright-cli` command),
`capabilities.publish` (artifact publish chokepoint — see below),
`capabilities.agentcore` (opt-in agent workload identity + Gateway MCP —
see below),
`capabilities.theme_persona` / `capabilities.theme_install`,
`capabilities.mobile_connect` (phone-connection methods: filters the
`GET /api/mobile-connect/methods` listing AND is re-checked fail-closed inside
both credential-mint endpoints — `/api/tailnet/mobile/qr` and
`/api/auth/mobile-link` — via `mint_denied_reason`, because a filtered list is
presentation, never the control. The mint re-check enforces TWO controls
fail-closed: the method must exist in the active `mobile_connect` provider's
set (an edition that removed a method disabled it — a direct POST does not
out-rank the seam), and governance must permit it. Default-allow standalone; a `methods` ruleset
narrows to individual method ids — `methods:tailnet_qr`, `methods:login_link`.
The default methods deliberately use ONE spelling for id and kind
(`tailnet_qr`, `login_link`), so a ruleset written against either binds; an
edition contributing its own method must keep that property or document its
ids. The built-in mint endpoints ARE the built-in methods — an edition adding
a new method ships its own mint endpoint and frontend renderer alongside its
descriptor. Every decision, list and mint alike, is SEL-audited through
`vet_and_audit`. Denying everything hides the dashboard's "Connect your phone"
entry; the method rows themselves come from the `mobile_connect` CPP seam —
see `platform-context.md`), and
`capabilities.telemetry` (the anonymous beacon: send gate + both write
chokepoints — **policy layer only**, see below), and
`capabilities.social_share` (the dashboard's "Share as image" entry — read
through `GET /api/dashboard/config`, every layer honoured, every decision
audited; see below), and `capabilities.feature_videos_download` (fetching the
signed feature-video manifest and its media from the vendor CDN — three
chokepoints, every layer honoured; see below). Only the live `approval_mode`
clamp remains reserved.

The `commands` scope now **doubles as the enterprise force-pin** for built-in
denied-command rules. A deny-mode `commands` ScopedRuleset's `deny` patterns are
projected as force-pins via `GovernanceCeiling.pinned_command_patterns()` /
`Profile.pinned_command_patterns()`, unioned by `resolve_pinned_commands(ceiling,
profile)` (order-preserving, deduped — deny composes by union, tightest-wins).
`hooks.py` unions these into the effective denied set, so an operator's
`security_policy.json` `commands.deny` patterns are **un-opt-out-able**: they
apply regardless of the user's `denied_commands.json` `disable_all` /
`disabled_ids`, because governance is Level-1 POLICY and the keystone opt-out is
operator-editable (agent-unwritable) state. This is `effective = POLICY ∩ PROFILE`,
tightest-wins, applied to command denials. Only deny-mode entries become pins;
an allow-mode `commands` allowlist is a deny-by-default gate enforced solely by
`gate_decision` and is NOT projected as a pin (the accessor returns `()`).
Because `security_policy.json` is on the `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` keystone (the
agent cannot write it — `assert_governance_paths_protected`), a pin is
un-opt-out-able by construction. NOTE: the governance `command` matcher is
case-sensitive `fnmatchcase` while the security union matches case-insensitively;
a pin is an independent ceiling that *covers the same command*, not literally the
same rule string. Double coverage (gate + security union) is intended and
harmless — both only deny. New public surface (reflected in `__all__`):
`COMMANDS_SCOPE`, `resolve_pinned_commands`; purely additive — no new
`SCOPE_CATALOG` row and no change to `resolve`/`gate_decision`/`load_security_policy`.

Two `security.py` accessors keep enforcement and display correctly scoped:
`pinned_builtin_command_ids()` (ENFORCEMENT) resolves the **active ceiling
only** — the hooks gate force-re-adds these so a user opt-out can't weaken a
*ceiling* pin, but it does NOT union other profiles' pins (a profile-A pin must
not force-enforce for profile B / a no-profile session; per-profile command
enforcement is the gate's bound-profile `_governance_denial` deny plane).
`pinned_builtin_command_ids_for_snapshot()` (DISPLAY) unions the ceiling pins
with **all** loaded profiles' pins (`all_profile_pinned_commands()`) for the
surface-agnostic Settings > Security snapshot + the builtin-toggle 409 check, so
a rule pinned by any profile renders locked and rejects a disable rather than
surfacing a no-op opt-out (UI success while the bound-profile gate still denies).
Display-only union — it does not widen enforcement.

`capabilities.agentcore` is a `CapabilityGate` (opt-in: `capability_default=False`,
like `capabilities.publish` / `capabilities.messaging`). It is a catalog data row
only — the evaluator is untouched. The inner `posture` field is policy data, not
a second scope and not a `CapabilityGate` field (`additionalProperties: false`
stays `enabled` + `scopes`): `workload` or `login`. An `enabled: true` document
with a missing or unknown `posture` fails closed — the row is treated as
disabled, or boot aborts when `boot.fail_closed`. A disabled or omitted row
does not require `posture`.

`CapabilityGate.from_dict` rejects a non-boolean `enabled` the same way
`ScopedRuleset.mode` rejects an unknown mode: `enabled: "false"` is not
coerced with `bool()`, and a present `enabled: null` is not treated as
absent. The default applies only when the key is omitted. The raise is
unconditional (including `boot.fail_closed=false`) and applies to every
capability row, not just `agentcore` — six catalog scopes default ON, so
a stringly-typed or null disable must not turn into a permit.

The composed posture is a **policy-only** ceiling side field
(`GovernanceCeiling.agentcore_identity_posture`, Rule 6 — same shape as Slack
`channels.posture` and `updates`). A profile may enable or disable the
capability (tightest-wins on `enabled`) but cannot carry `posture`,
`gateway_url`, or `workload_name`: those keys are rejected at parse, the same
fail-closed raise as `ScopedMap.posture` / `updates` / `fallback`.
Enable-without-posture is the legal profile shape; it cannot turn the seam on
alone, because an omitted policy has no stored posture. Read the composed
value through the public helper
`agentcore_posture(ceiling) -> "workload" | "login" | None` — do not re-parse
raw policy JSON. The helper returns the stored posture only when the
capability is enabled with a known value; `None` when the ceiling is missing,
the capability is omitted, disabled, or fail-closed-disabled.

`gateway_url` (https MCP URL, no credentials, no fragment, no internal
whitespace) and `workload_name`
(3–255 of `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]`) are the same policy-only shape. Validators live
in `platform/agentcore_schema.py` so policy parse does not import AWS.
Consumption ANDs three conjuncts: the `agent_identity` adapter is on,
governance permits `capabilities.agentcore`, and `agentcore_posture(ceiling)`
is a known value. The public `DefaultAgentIdentityProvider` is disabled, so a
standalone host with no policy is unchanged. Later stack PRs consult this row
at rebuild / Gateway injection; naming it here is what lets a policy pin the
capability before those chokepoints land.

`capabilities.publish` is a `CapabilityGate` (opt-in: `capability_default=False`)
with an inner `destinations` `ScopedRuleset` (`identifier` matcher) bounding
which publish-provider ids are allowed once the capability is on — the direct
analogue of `capabilities.spawn`'s `agents` ruleset. It is enforced at a Plane-C
out-of-band chokepoint — `publish_governance.publish_denied_reason` — NOT at the
host PreToolUse gate: publishing is a user-driven dashboard HTTP action ("NOT LLM
tools"), so the title-gate never sees it. The chokepoint calls
`governance_permits("capabilities.publish", "destinations:<provider_id>", …)`
BEFORE dispatching to the provider, and additionally honours the standalone
operator's `publish.allowed_destinations` config allowlist (default-open,
narrow-only — config can never widen past the ceiling, mirroring the Slack
enterprise allowlist). This scope is distinct from the `git push` deny FLOOR and
from `network.egress`: `capabilities.publish.enabled: true` never re-enables git
publish (the floor is ADD-only and unconditional) nor a fetch host. WHO
implements a destination is the orthogonal CPP `PublishRegistry` seam; governance
decides only WHETHER + to WHERE, and runs first.

Callers (one decision, several surfaces — the helper lives in its own module so a
second surface cannot grow a drifting copy):

| Surface | Destination id | On deny |
|---|---|---|
| `api_artifact_publish` + its sharing/review siblings (`handlers/artifacts.py`, via the module-local `_publish_governance_denied` alias) | the requested/effective `publication.provider` | 403 |
| `GET /api/publish-providers` (`apps/routes.py`) | `deploy-web-aws` | the row is omitted, so the button never renders |
| `POST /api/deploy/deploy` (`deploy/handlers.py`) | `deploy-web-aws` | 403, audited `deploy/denied` |
| `POST /api/deploy/pending/{id}/confirm` | `deploy-web-aws` | 403 BEFORE `claim_pending`, so a denied confirm does not consume the entry |

The deploy-path callers are what make the public-web destination genuinely
closable: hiding the provider row alone would be presentation, not a control
(the endpoint is reachable directly, and the `deploy_artifact` MCP preview goes
through `/api/deploy/deploy` too), and gating only the initial deploy would leave
a pending entry created before the ceiling changed still confirmable. Because the
deploy path shares `publish.allowed_destinations`, an operator who had already
narrowed that list for the registry must add `deploy-web-aws` to keep deploying —
intentional: the list states which destinations are permitted, and the core
deploy provider was previously the one destination exempt from it.

Unlike the messaging/cron chokepoints (which degrade-to-permit on a transient
governance-evaluation error so a latent regression can't wedge the surface),
publish is an **authorization** decision whose wrong-permit is a data
exfiltration — so it fails **CLOSED**. Because `governance_permits` catches its
OWN internal errors (and would otherwise return a permissive "no opinion"
Decision), the handler passes `fail_closed=True`: an error raised *inside*
`governance_permits` then returns a DENYING Decision (audited `failed_closed`),
not a permit. The chokepoint also evaluates the **effective** destination — for
an already-published artifact `publish_sync.publish` dispatches to the existing
`publication.provider`, so the gate resolves that provider (not the requested/
default one) before deciding, or a re-publish with no explicit provider could be
gated against the wrong destination.

### Governed capability: theme-pack persona injection

Installed theme packs (see `themes.md`) can carry a `persona.md` that
`_maybe_inject_persona` prepends to the first user turn — the first
user-installed content path that shapes agent behavior. This surface is
**governed by the `capabilities.theme_persona` `SCOPE_CATALOG` capability
row** (`capability_default=True`): standalone it defaults to allow, but an
enterprise POLICY can force-disable **installed-pack persona injection** —
the scope this row enforces today. (It does NOT gate L2 asset serving —
overlays/topbar/audio keep working under a denying policy; if wholesale L2
disablement is wanted it will be its own row or an extension of this one,
tracked with kirodotdev/KiroCrew#312.) The decision is consulted at the
injection site
(`chat_runner.py`, via `governance_permits("capabilities.theme_persona",
"", session_key=...)`); a denying policy skips injection silently (info log).
It is a **data row only** — `CONTRACT_VERSION` is unchanged and the evaluator
(`resolve`/`gate_decision`/`load_security_policy`) is untouched, per this
spec's design.

**Companion row — pack installation.** The wider content-ingestion surface
(`POST /api/themes/install`, including a server-side `git clone` of a remote
pack, then serving its sandboxed JS + assets into the dashboard) is governed by
a sibling `capabilities.theme_install` `SCOPE_CATALOG` capability row
(`capability_default=True`, same data-only shape — no `CONTRACT_VERSION` or
evaluator change). Standalone it defaults to allow; a managed-fleet POLICY can
ban pack installation wholesale. Consulted in `api_themes_install`
(`handlers/themes.py`, via `governance_permits("capabilities.theme_install",
"", fail_closed=True)`) **before any fetch/clone**; a denying policy — or a
governance-evaluation error (admission chokepoint fails closed) — returns `403`
and ingests nothing.

Rationale for the tone-only surface (context, not a reason to leave it
ungoverned):

- The persona is **tone-only by construction**: it is injected as message
  text, not policy — it cannot grant tools, change refusals, alter the deny
  patterns, or move any governance ceiling. Every tool call the persona-styled
  agent makes still passes the full PreToolUse gate, so the Level-1 POLICY
  ceiling continues to bind all agent *actions* regardless of persona.
- Activation requires a locally installed pack (filesystem access to
  `~/.kiro/crew/themes/`) plus a per-content sha grant — an actor with that
  access is already inside the trust boundary the POLICY ceiling models.
- The persona-injection force-disable that a plain in-boundary actor could
  not otherwise get is now available to an enterprise POLICY via the
  capability row above (this supersedes the earlier "deferred to a follow-up
  row" decision for the persona surface).

**Recorded maintainer decision (2026-07-24, PR #107):** "consent =
surprise-prevention UX, not authorization" is **accepted as the v1
contract** for installed-pack personas, and `capabilities.theme_persona`
ships `capability_default=True`. Rationale: KiroCrew is a single-user,
self-hosted tool where the pack installer is the machine owner; the persona is
tone-only, content-bound (sha256), and enterprise-disableable via the row
above — while a default-off would make every installed persona silently dead
on arrival. The considered stronger alternatives (server-recorded grants,
default-off until a headless consent story exists) were explicitly declined
for v1; server-side grant persistence remains the optional half of
kirodotdev/KiroCrew#312 and MAY tighten the model later without breaking this
contract (a stricter server is backward-compatible with consenting clients).
**Revisit trigger:** #312 MUST be revisited before any persona-scope
expansion (longer length bound, per-turn injection, or richer pack tiers) —
scope growth without server-recorded grants is not covered by this decision.

### Anonymous telemetry — `capabilities.telemetry`

The anonymous daily heartbeat and official-app install receipt (`beacon.py` and
`apps/install_receipt.py`; full spec in [metrics.md](metrics.md) → "Anonymous
outbound telemetry"), together with the in-app session-pulse survey
(`dashboard/handlers/feedback.py`), are the repo's **only default-on egress
family**. All three gate on the same `beacon.telemetry_permitted` effective-enable
ladder. The heartbeat and install receipt send fixed anonymous payloads; the
survey egresses the user's own submitted answers plus an anonymous per-install
id (`beacon.install_id`), and only once that same ladder — including the
first-run privacy disclosure — permits it. They are governed
by the `capabilities.telemetry` `SCOPE_CATALOG` capability row
(`capability_default=True`, data-only shape — no `CONTRACT_VERSION` or evaluator
change, mirroring the theme rows above).

**Why a governance row when a Settings toggle already exists.** The toggle, the CLI
and the `KIROCREW_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` env var are all *operator* controls: anyone on
the machine can flip them, and the agent can reach the first two. A managed fleet
frequently may not egress to a vendor endpoint at all, which needs a control the
running app cannot undo. Because the row is read from the trust-root
`security_policy.json` — inside `security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`, so the agent can
neither read nor rewrite its own ceiling — this is genuinely un-opt-out-able where a
`config.json` field would only be a suggestion.

Consulted at **four** chokepoints — the send gate plus EVERY write path to
`telemetry.beacon_enabled`; any one alone would be a half-control:

| Chokepoint | Pinned-off behavior |
|---|---|
| `beacon.telemetry_permitted()` | Refuses both heartbeat and receipt egress. Ranked **above** the config flag so the reported reason names the policy, not the (now irrelevant) local value |
| `PATCH /api/config/kirocrew` (`handlers/core.py`) | **403** on `telemetry.beacon_enabled=true` |
| `kirocrew telemetry enable` (`cli_commands.py`) | Exits **1** without writing config.json |
| `kirocrew config set [--local] …` (`cli_config.py`) | Exits **1** without writing. The *generic* setter reaches the same key, and `--local` writes the overlay that takes PRECEDENCE over the base file |

Writing `false` is **always** permitted at both write chokepoints. The ceiling is a
floor on privacy, so a narrower local choice composes with it (tightest-wins), and
refusing it would leave a user unable to record a stricter preference they already
have in effect — and strand them if the policy were later lifted.

The write refusals exist so a pinned host cannot sit storing `beacon_enabled: true`
behind a control that does nothing: `should_send` already blocks the egress, so
without them the config file and the UI would both claim "on" while nothing is sent.

**Fails CLOSED** (`fail_closed=True`), joining `capabilities.theme_install` /
`capabilities.publish` rather than diverging from them. An earlier revision of this
row failed open on the reasoning that "a wrong deny only loses a heartbeat"; that
reasoning describes the wrong-DENY and quietly ignores the wrong-PERMIT, which is
an **egress on a fleet that explicitly forbade egress** — the one thing this scope
exists to prevent, on a payload that leaves the machine. `fail_closed` also
promotes the degrade to a critical SEL event, so an unevaluable ceiling is visible
rather than silently permissive.

**Audited at the enforcement call, not on the probe.** `should_send` (the decision
that actually stops an egress) routes through `vet_and_audit` — the existing
audited seam — so a suppressed heartbeat lands a `governance_decision` SEL record
with the same shape as the messaging chokepoints, grant or deny. The **read-only**
path (`status()` → `GET /api/telemetry/beacon`, which the Privacy panel refetches)
passes `audit=False`: auditing an *inspection* would append HMAC-chained rows at a
multiple of the one decision per boot that governs anything. This is the same
disposition the channels gate applies to its hot-path default-permit — audit the
decision that does something, not the question.

The probe is `beacon.is_governance_pinned_off()`, surfaced as
`governance_override` on `GET /api/telemetry/beacon`; the Privacy panel shows it as
the strongest of three pinned-notes (it outranks the env-var and overlay notes,
which would otherwise suggest remedies the ceiling makes pointless).

**POLICY LAYER ONLY — this row is Level-1 in a way the others are not.** The probe
requires `layer == "policy"`, so a **Level-2 profile** setting
`capabilities.telemetry.enabled: false` does **not** suppress the beacon, even
though the read-only viewer will render that row as governed with a `profile`
source. Two reasons, and the narrowing is what makes the control trustworthy
rather than weaker:

- The probe is **process-wide and carries no session**. It runs from the beacon's
  detached boot thread, so `_infer_surface("")` classifies to `unknown` and matches
  no bind — a per-surface ceiling is simply not the question "should this
  installation send a daily heartbeat" asks.
- A bare not-permitted test is **wrong in a way no `except` can catch**:
  `resolve_active_scope` returns a synthetic deny-all *profile*
  (`_deny_all_unloaded:…`) when the profile store is unprimed and another thread
  holds its non-blocking reload lock. That is a transient race on a host with **no
  policy at all**, and it arrives as an ordinary `Decision`, not an exception — so
  reading it as a pin would make the CLI, the 403, and the UI note all blame an
  administrator who does not exist. `TestGovernancePin` pins both directions.

So the probe reads **three** outcomes, not two: a policy-layer deny is a pin, a
degrade (`reason` prefixed `GOVERNANCE_ERROR_REASON`) is a pin (fail-closed), and a
profile-layer deny is not.

This mirrors the policy-only treatment `ScopedMap.posture` and the Slack posture
check already get. A profile-layer telemetry suppression would need its own
session-bearing chokepoint, not this probe.

The Security panel picks the row up automatically — `api_governance_policy` iterates
`SCOPE_CATALOG` — and labels it **"Anonymous telemetry"** rather than the leaf's
bare "Telemetry", because this scope governs only the outbound heartbeat and NOT the
unrelated local-only `telemetry.enabled` OTEL collection.

### Tailnet origin derivation — `capabilities.tailnet_origin`

`dashboard.tailscale.enabled` lets the gateway ask the local Tailscale daemon for
this machine's MagicDNS name at startup and add `https://<name>` to the CSRF origin
allowlist and the DNS-rebinding `Host` barrier, so `tailscale serve` reaches the
dashboard without a hand-written `dashboard.url` (`dashboard/tailnet.py`; RFC
`request-for-change/rfc-tailnet-dashboard-access.md`). Governed by the
`capabilities.tailnet_origin` `SCOPE_CATALOG` capability row
(`capability_default=True`, data-only shape — no `CONTRACT_VERSION` or evaluator
change, mirroring the telemetry and theme rows above).

**Why a governance row.** The config switch is an *operator* control that the agent
can reach through the generic config setter. What a managed fleet objects to is not
a preference but two effects it may forbid outright: **running the tailnet CLI on a
managed host**, and **widening the set of origins the gateway accepts
authenticated, state-changing requests from**. Read from the trust-root
`security_policy.json` (inside `security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`, so the agent can
neither read nor rewrite its own ceiling), the row is a control the running app
cannot undo.

Consulted at **four** chokepoints — the derivation, the publish action, and every
write path to `dashboard.tailscale.enabled`; any one alone would be a
half-control:

| Chokepoint | Pinned-off behavior |
|---|---|
| `tailnet.resolve_tailnet_host()` | Contributes no origin **and does not spawn the CLI**, so the pin closes both halves an administrator objects to. Checked ahead of the daemon call |
| `tailnet_serve.publish()` | Refuses to run `tailscale serve`, so the dashboard is never put on the tailnet in the first place. Checked before the spawn — refusing after publishing would be theatre |
| `PATCH /api/config/kirocrew` (`handlers/core.py`) | **403** on `dashboard.tailscale.enabled=true` |
| `kirocrew config set [--local] …` (`cli_config.py`) | Exits **1** without writing. The generic setter reaches the same key, and `--local` writes the overlay that takes PRECEDENCE over the base file |

`tailnet_serve.unpublish()` is deliberately **not** gated, and the asymmetry is
load-bearing rather than an oversight. `is_governance_pinned_off` returns true both
for a real policy deny and for a ceiling it could not evaluate, so gating withdrawal
would mean a transient policy-read failure leaves a dashboard published on a tailnet
with no supported way to take it down — a fail-closed control failing open in
effect. Removing exposure is always permitted, the same direction that lets a config
write of `false` through while `true` is refused.

Writing `false` is **always** permitted, for the reason the telemetry row gives:
the ceiling is a floor, so a narrower local choice composes with it and refusing it
would strand a user who wants to record a stricter preference already in effect.

The write refusals exist so a pinned host cannot sit storing `enabled: true` behind
a switch that does nothing — the derivation is already suppressed, so without them
the config file and the Security panel card would both claim "on" while no origin is
trusted and `tailscale serve` still fails the Origin check.

**Fails CLOSED** (`fail_closed=True`), joining `capabilities.telemetry` /
`theme_install` / `publish`. The two dispositions are not symmetric: a wrong-DENY
costs a convenience and leaves the explicit-`dashboard.url` path exactly as it is
today, while a wrong-PERMIT **widens a security boundary on a fleet that forbade
it**. `fail_closed` also promotes the degrade to a critical SEL event, so an
unevaluable ceiling is visible rather than silently permissive.

**Audited at the enforcement call, not on the probe** — the same disposition
telemetry documents, for the same reason. `resolve_tailnet_host` and both write
chokepoints pass an `audit_tool`, so a suppressed derivation and a refused write
each leave a `governance_decision` SEL record. `GET /api/tailnet/status`, which the
Security panel's card refetches, passes none: auditing an *inspection* would append
HMAC-chained rows for a question rather than a decision.

**POLICY LAYER ONLY**, and the probe reads **three** outcomes rather than two, both
exactly as the telemetry row above spells out: a policy-layer deny is a pin, a
degrade (`reason` prefixed `GOVERNANCE_ERROR_REASON`) is a pin, and a profile-layer
deny is **not** — because `resolve_active_scope` returns a synthetic deny-all
profile during an unprimed-store race, and reading that as a pin would make the
startup warning, the 403 and the CLI refusal all blame an administrator who does not
exist. The probe also runs once at gateway startup carrying no session, so a
per-surface Level-2 ceiling is not the question it asks.

The Security panel picks the row up automatically (`api_governance_policy` iterates
`SCOPE_CATALOG`), and the tailnet card additionally renders `governance_pinned` as a
distinct `pinned` state — the card must separate "off because the operator left the
switch off" (flippable) from "off because an administrator pinned it" (a config
write returns 403), since offering a working-looking toggle for the second is the
half-control this row exists to avoid.

### Hosted feature-video media — `capabilities.feature_videos_download`

Feature-intro clips are hosted, not bundled: the gateway fetches a signed manifest
from a vendor CloudFront distribution and downloads the media it lists into
`~/.kiro/crew/feature-videos/<release>/` (`feature_videos_manifest.py`,
`feature_videos_cache.py`; user-facing doc `feature-videos.md`). That is outbound
traffic to a vendor endpoint plus third-party bytes landing on disk — two things a
managed fleet frequently may not do at all. Governed by the
`capabilities.feature_videos_download` `SCOPE_CATALOG` capability row
(`capability_default=True`, data-only shape — no `CONTRACT_VERSION` or evaluator
change, mirroring the rows above).

**Three chokepoints, because any one alone is a half-control.** Each manifest
request (the fallback walk re-asks before every candidate url, so no request is
made after a withdrawal and nothing is learned), each clip request in the download pass
(the poster and the clip each take their own audited answer, so no media lands on
disk after a withdrawal), and `POST /api/feature-videos/fetch-all` (refused 403
rather than accepted into a task that would deny itself). All three are server-side,
and that is the whole surface: the BROWSER never reaches the CDN, because the server
never hands it a CDN url. An uncached hosted clip is not offered at all — a remote
`src` would have the browser play bytes the sha256 pin never checked and follow
redirects the gateway's own opener refuses — so `feature_videos.validate_asset_path`
admits only this origin, and the ceiling has no client-side leg to govern.

**Already-cached clips keep playing under a denial.** Withdrawing bytes that are
already on disk is a separate decision this row does not make; a denied install
offers its local entries and nothing else.

**Shape: the social-share read, not the startup probes.** `vet_and_audit` on the
pinned `dashboard:ui` surface key — never a caller-controlled header — and every
denied decision is honoured whichever layer produced it, so a Level-2 profile bound
to the dashboard can withdraw the fetch. The frontend reads the answer as
`download_enabled` on `GET /api/feature-videos/status` (the settings panel) and
`/next` (the modal), so it never guesses and never has to discover the ceiling
through a 403. It is deliberately NOT repeated on `GET /api/dashboard/config`: that
route is fetched on every dashboard load by every install, and an audited
`download_denied()` there would spend a governance decision — and a SEL row — on a
readout nobody consumes.

**Fails CLOSED** (`fail_closed=True`), joining `capabilities.publish` /
`theme_install` / `telemetry` / `tailnet_origin` / `social_share`: a wrong-DENY
withholds an intro clip, a wrong-PERMIT makes a vendor-CDN request on a fleet that
forbade vendor egress. An unevaluable ceiling is audited as the denial it produces.

**No CSP change.** `media-src` stays `'self' blob:`. Every clip the dashboard plays
is served from this origin — a bundled asset or a downloaded, verified one — so the
policy needs no off-origin media host, and a header that admitted one would be
admitting a fetch the server never offers.

### "Share as image" — `capabilities.social_share`

The chat's *More actions → Share as image* turns an assistant reply into a branded
PNG card with a prefilled caption and offers to post it to X or LinkedIn
(`website/src/pages/chat/share/`). The card is rendered and exported **in the
browser** — copy and download never leave the machine, and there is no upload — but
the intent buttons hand the caption text to a third-party site inside a URL. That
makes the entry an egress path for agent output, which a managed fleet may forbid
wholesale. Governed by the `capabilities.social_share` `SCOPE_CATALOG` capability
row (`capability_default=True`, data-only shape — no `CONTRACT_VERSION` or evaluator
change, mirroring the rows above).

**Why the chokepoint is a read.** There is no server-side share action to refuse:
nothing is rendered, stored or posted by the gateway. The control is the dashboard
entry itself, and the only way the dashboard can learn the ceiling's answer is the
endpoint it already fetches — `GET /api/dashboard/config` reports a read-only
`social_share_enabled` (`dashboard/social_share.py`), and the frontend draws the
menu item only when it is `true`. The entry stays hidden until the server has
answered — the endpoint is the authority, the frontend never guesses (the same
posture as the mobile-connect rail row). When Share was the menu's only item (a
loaded window keeps fork/plan as row buttons), the trigger is withdrawn with it
rather than opening an empty menu. A swap that lands while the share dialog is
already open does **not** unmount it: the dialog stays with the user's edited
caption in place, its four share actions are disabled, a notice names the cause and
tells the user to copy their text now (it is not saved on close), and a plain-text
Copy affordance — the caption plus the card's editable text, local clipboard, no
image, no site — stays available so closing
never means silent loss; when the clipboard refuses, the button says so and
selects the caption for a keyboard copy rather than looking like success. The
notice does not name who set the policy (a fleet ceiling and an operator's own
profile pin both land here). In the Security panel's ceiling viewer the scope's row
is labelled after the menu entry it withdraws ("Share as image", translated), so a
user who lost the entry can connect the row to the feature. The field is dropped
from the `PUT` body (both settings surfaces round-trip the whole `GET`), so it can
never be written: governance, not config, owns the answer.

**Shape: the mobile-connect listing, not the startup probes.** The evaluation runs
through `vet_and_audit` on the pinned `dashboard:ui` surface key — never a
caller-controlled header, which would let a request dodge a profile bound to the
dashboard surface — and **every denied decision is honoured**, whichever layer
produced it. This is a per-request dashboard question, so unlike `telemetry` and
`tailnet_origin` (process-wide, session-less, evaluated once at boot) there is no
policy-layer-only carve-out: a Level-2 profile narrowing the dashboard can withdraw
the entry.

**Fails CLOSED** (`fail_closed=True`), joining `capabilities.publish` /
`theme_install` / `telemetry` / `tailnet_origin`: a wrong-DENY hides a convenience
menu item, a wrong-PERMIT offers a "post this to a third-party site" button on a
fleet that forbade it. An unevaluable ceiling is recorded as `denied` with a
`fail-closed` reason.

**Every decision is audited.** Each evaluation the dashboard acts on leaves a
`governance_decision` SEL row (tool `dashboard_config_social_share`), grant and
denial alike, through the shared seam — the read *is* the enforcement here, so it
is not an inspection to leave unrecorded. The endpoint is not polled: the client
fetches it on mount, focus and after its stale window, and otherwise only when the
WS `slots` frame reports a generation change (below).

**Follows a mid-session ceiling swap.** `policy_distribution.apply_ceiling` can
replace the ceiling without a restart. The WS `slots` frame carries the process-local
`governanceGeneration` alongside `gitlabHostsGeneration`; every dashboard-user
socket's existing 5-second status pusher (`ws.py`, `_push_status`) compares the
counter on each tick and asks for a coalesced slots push when it moves — no task of
its own, and deliberately separate from the owner-only credential-refresh driver, so
a fleet that tightened policy while only a non-owner window was open still reaches
that window; the initial frame and the tick's baseline come from one read, so a swap
during connection setup registers as a change. The client invalidates its cached
`dashboardConfig` on a change (and on each connection's first frame, since the
counter restarts with the process) — so a withdrawn entry disappears within one
status tick rather than waiting out the cache's stale window.

**And follows a profile-layer edit.** The value in that frame is
`governance_profiles.governance_answer_generation()`, which is
`context.governance_generation()` plus a module-private `_profile_generation()`
bumped whenever `ProfileStore._ensure_fresh` publishes a new snapshot. The field's
contract is unchanged — it stays an opaque, comparison-only integer, so combining two
monotonic counters is not a change of meaning and no consumer needs to know. This
exists because the ceiling counter alone missed Level-2 edits: a profile file
tightening a capability is enforced on the very next decision (the authorization
path calls `_ensure_fresh`), while the dashboard's cached answer kept the withdrawn
entry until its 30-second stale window, focus, or an unrelated slot mutation.

Detecting the edit needs the profiles directory re-stat'd, and on an idle dashboard
nothing else would touch the store, so the watcher has to be what looks. That walk
lives in a separate `poll_profiles_fresh()`, which the watcher offloads with
`asyncio.to_thread`: `_dir_fingerprint` is an `iterdir` plus a `stat` per file, and
AUTOSDE's `no-blocking-call-on-event-loop` names filesystem walks as the prohibited
class, so a slow or large profile store must delay one socket's tick rather than
stall chat turns and heartbeats for every session. `governance_answer_generation()`
itself is two locked integer reads with no filesystem access, which is why the
synchronous slots broadcast may call it inline. Measured walk cost on one host: 57us
at 5 profile files, 107us at 15, 303us at 50, 1.12ms at 200 — small at a realistic
count and unbounded in principle, hence offloaded rather than defended by the number.

`_profile_generation()` is an OUTPUT of the profile store and must never become an
input to it. Folding it into `_ceiling_token()` — the obvious-looking symmetry with
the ceiling half described below — would make the store reload on every access
forever, because `_ensure_fresh` computes its fingerprint *before* reloading and so
would commit a pre-bump value that the next read can never match.

The Security panel picks the row up automatically (`api_governance_policy` iterates
`SCOPE_CATALOG`; its label is the humanised leaf, "Social share").

### Which ACP harness a deployment may select — `agent_backend`

`agent.acp_backend` chooses the harness a session runs on (kiro-cli, KAS, and
whatever an edition registered — see [harness-parity.md](harness-parity.md)).
Two different questions decide whether a value is usable, and keeping them apart
is what this row is for:

- **Can this build serve it?** `acp_backends.selectable_backends()` — a
  capability fact contributed by the edition that called
  `register_selectable_backend`. Not governable: no policy can conjure a harness
  the build has no code for.
- **May THIS DEPLOYMENT select it?** the `agent_backend` `SCOPE_CATALOG` row
  (a `ScopedRuleset` on the `identifier` matcher; data-only shape — no
  `CONTRACT_VERSION` or evaluator change, mirroring the rows above), so a managed
  fleet can qualify one harness and bound the rest.

**Members are POLICY ids, not the code's spelling** — `kiro` / `kas` / `claude`,
translated by `acp_backends.POLICY_ID_BY_BACKEND`. `ACP_BACKEND_KIRO` is the
empty string internally, which no identifier matcher can carry: an empty
allow/deny entry is indistinguishable from a typo'd blank a JSON linter would
keep. The wire vocabulary is therefore owned in one place rather than translated
at each reader.

**Additive over a floor — the semantics ruling that unblocked
[issue #6622](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues/6622).**

```json
{"agent_backend": {"mode": "allow", "allow": ["claude"]}}
```

means **also allow claude**, not **only claude**: `kiro` stays selectable because
`acp_backends.GOVERNANCE_FLOOR_BACKEND` is never submitted to the scope at all,
so no rule can remove it. The exclusive reading was rejected because it can empty
the selectable set, and an install with **no startable harness cannot be repaired
from the dashboard** — the trust-root `security_policy.json` is the one file the
dashboard may not write (see
[Self-protection](#self-protection-the-keystone)). The guarantee does not rest on
the governance caller being careful either: `apply_selectable_denials` force-keeps
the floor even when a caller names it in `denied`. Issue #6622 remains open for
the wider enforcement question; only the semantics is settled here.

kiro-cli is the floor rather than KAS deliberately. KAS is not an independent
harness — it is served by kiro-cli's own ACP relay
(`acp/kas_transport.build_kas_argv`) — so a KAS floor would rest on the same
binary while adding a second thing that can be absent. The floor has to be the
member with the fewest preconditions of its own; revisit if KAS ever ships a
binary of its own.

**Enforced by RECOMPUTING the registry, not by a per-decision read.** This is the
one scope here whose answer is materialised instead of resolved at each decision.
`agent_backend_governance.narrow_selectable_backends()` iterates the BASELINE
(`registered_backends()`), asks the scope about every non-floor member, and
assigns `baseline - denied` whole via `apply_selectable_denials`. One call site,
**outside** `KiroCrewConfig.load()`:

| Call site | When | Why it is needed |
|---|---|---|
| `platform/bootstrap.py::bootstrap_context` | after `set_context`, and after every edition's `register_acp_backends` | the first session already sees the policy, and nothing an edition registers later escapes it |

**When a policy change binds: the next gateway start.** `apply_ceiling` replaces
`current_context().governance` mid-process — the poll thread reaches it through
`refresh_now()` — and every other scope on this page picks that up on its next
decision. This one does not, deliberately.

Re-deriving the registry there would bind the new ceiling for backend SELECTION only.
Sessions already running the now-denied harness, and providers already in the warm
pool, keep going: nothing in this scope can retire them, because retiring live work is
a session-lifecycle capability that does not exist yet. The operator-visible result
would be the worst of both — the option disappears from the panel while the harness is
still in use, which reads as "it stopped being used". A narrow promise kept beats a
broad one that quietly holds only for new sessions, so the contract is stated plainly
instead: the set is decided at gateway start, and editing policy takes effect on the
next start. The dashboard panel says exactly that
(`set_is_fixed_at_gateway_start`), and
`test_apply_ceiling_does_not_renarrow_the_registry` pins it so the omission cannot be
mistaken for an oversight and quietly "fixed" without the retirement half.

Assigning rather than subtracting still earns its place at one call site: the recompute
is idempotent, order-independent and reversible, so adding the runtime call site once
retirement exists is a one-line change rather than a redesign of the primitive.

**Why it cannot be a per-decision read like every other scope.** Three
harness-parity invariants rule out each of the otherwise-obvious positions:

- **H3** — the single selectability gate `resolve_selected_backend` runs inside
  `KiroCrewConfig.load()` and must never read the platform context:
  `current_context()`'s lazy branch loads config, so resolving a ceiling there
  re-enters the load that called it. The gate cannot ask.
- **H4** — selectability has exactly ONE gate. A second derivation (an
  intersection in the dashboard handler, say) is the drift the registry replaced.
- **H13** — the Kiro construction path gains no conditional in service of an
  adapter, which rules out `create_provider_factory`; a test asserts no governance
  call appears there.

Narrowing the registry satisfies all three: the context is installed at both call
sites (so no re-entrant load), the registry stays the single source, and no call
site changes. Everything downstream inherits the narrowed answer with no code of
its own — `resolve_selected_backend` degrades a now-denied persisted value to the
floor with a logged reason on the next load, and the `PATCH
/api/config/kirocrew` allowlist, `GET /api/config/schema`, `GET /api/acp-backends`
and the provider factory all read the one derivation
(`handlers/core.py::_selectable_acp_backends`). `bootstrap_context` additionally
re-runs that SAME gate over the config instance it is holding — that instance was
normalised before the narrowing — rather than adding a second gate anywhere.

**`GET /api/acp-backends`** is the operator-facing view of the outcome: one
owner-only row per backend in `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`, carrying `selectable` (build
capability ∩ this deployment's policy, from the derivation above) beside
`installed` (is the harness on THIS machine, from `agent_sdk.probe_backends`).
The two facts are deliberately not conflated: a policy-denied harness and an
uninstalled
one need different operator remedies, and the dashboard must not offer an install
instruction for a backend an administrator pinned off.

**Fails CLOSED to the floor, which is what keeps fail-closed from meaning
bricked.** `governance_permits(..., fail_closed=True)` denies for an error raised
inside it, and `_scope_permits` additionally denies for what that helper does not
swallow (an absent platform context, an import failure) — so an unqualified
harness never becomes selectable on an unreadable policy. Without the floor,
closed and bricked would be the same state. `narrow_selectable_backends` itself
never raises: a boot that aborts because a policy could not be evaluated is worse
than one that starts on the floor alone, and the same holds for a runtime refresh
whose caller keeps serving traffic either way (it leaves the registry as it was,
plus a logged warning).

**Audited in BOTH directions**, unlike the publish gate which audits denials
only. Every decision lands a `governance_decision` SEL record through
`log_governance_decision` with `outcome` `"allowed"` / `"denied"` — the vocabulary
`sel.py` pins and `governance_profiles` emits, so a log query for allowed
decisions cannot miss this scope. The full record is affordable precisely because
the decision is materialised: it runs once per gateway start and once per pushed
ceiling, not per panel open — and *which harnesses did this deployment admit* is
the question an operator actually reconstructs afterwards, which a denials-only
log cannot answer. Audit failure is swallowed: an unwritable log must not decide
which harness starts.

Every decision is bound to `HOST_SESSION_KEY` (`_host`), **not** an empty session
key, and that is load-bearing rather than cosmetic: an empty key classifies to
surface `unknown` and matches no profile, so a `surface:host` profile would be
silently ignored and the harness it denies would stay selectable. It is the same
binding app activation and the messaging host gates use — see
[`host` surface](#profile-resolution--binding).

The Security panel picks the row up automatically — `api_governance_policy`
iterates `SCOPE_CATALOG`.

### Which tool-approval modes a deployment may select — `approval_modes`

The dashboard approval-mode picker offers four modes: `normal` (interactive —
ask for every tool), `trust_reads` (auto-approve reads), `trust` (auto-approve
the active slot), and `yolo` (auto-approve every tool everywhere). The
`approval_modes` `SCOPE_CATALOG` row (a `ScopedRuleset` on the `identifier`
matcher — data-only shape, no evaluator change, mirroring `agent_backend`
above) lets a managed fleet forbid an auto-approve mode and force interactive
approval.

**Today the scope governs exactly one mode: `yolo`.**

```json
{"approval_modes": {"mode": "deny", "deny": ["yolo"]}}
```

This is distinct from the ordinal `approval_mode` scale
(`yolo < auto < interactive`) documented under the archetypes: that clamps a
single ceiling, whereas `approval_modes` denies a named mode.

**Three modes are non-deniable, for two different reasons.** Both are declared as
catalog DATA — `ScopeSpec(..., always_permitted=("normal", "trust", "trust_reads"))`
— and `_parse_control` refuses any ruleset that forbids one, whether directly
(`deny: ["trust"]`) or by an allow-list that omits it, with
`PlatformCompositionError`. Data rather than a scope-name branch, so a second scope
with a non-deniable member is a catalog entry and not another `if` in the loader:

- **`normal` is the interactive floor.** Denying it would leave no selectable mode
  and brick tool approval, and the trust-root `security_policy.json` is the one file
  the dashboard may not write to repair it (see
  [Self-protection](#self-protection-the-keystone)).
- **`trust` and `trust_reads` are not yet governed.** Their grants are honoured by
  consumption predicates this scope does not reach — the in-memory trusted set, and
  the session `approval_policy` a spawned subagent inherits — spread across the
  messaging, Slack, Telegram and subagent-admission paths. Accepting a deny for them
  would advertise a control that does not hold, so the policy is refused **loudly at
  parse time** instead. Governing those read paths is tracked separately.

The refusal happens at parse time in both cases, because a policy that misdescribes
the posture is worse than one that fails to load.

**Enforced at every `yolo` surface**, because a mode is only actually off if every
path that can arm it — and every path that HONOURS an existing grant — refuses:

- `dashboard/chat_handlers.py::api_chat_mode` — the explicit mode switch. Refuses
  with `403` + `mode_disabled_by_policy` **before any mutation**.
- `safety_override` arming — `_commit_activation` and `activate_scoped`,
  fail-closed, so YOLO stays blocked however it is armed (dashboard, Slack `!yolo`,
  the `/yolo` slash handler, config).
- `safety_override.is_active` / `is_scope_active` / `renew_scoped` — the consult
  points that honour a LIVE grant. Gating only at arming left an already-armed grant
  running to its own TTL, so an admin who denied `yolo` mid-session kept
  auto-approving every tool for up to 24h.

**A denial REVOKES the grant; it does not merely mask it.** This matters because the
same predicate answers two different questions. `is_active` is both "may this tool
auto-approve?" and, for every caller that asks "is there a grant to clear?", the
liveness test — Slack's `!yolo off` is `if is_yolo_mode(): disable_yolo()`. An earlier
revision left `_active` set and only reported `False`, so inside a denial window that
branch reported "already off" and cleared nothing, and a later policy relaxation
resurrected auto-approve the operator had explicitly revoked. Tearing the grant down
makes both readings agree. The cost is that a policy which denies and then relaxes
requires a fresh arm, which is the honest outcome anyway.

The teardown runs at the moment the denying ceiling is INSTALLED, not on the next
`is_active()` call — `safety_override.revoke_for_policy` drops the session-wide grant
and every scoped grant, then fires `_on_expired("policy")`. That callback is the rest
of the revocation, and it is not optional: a dashboard grant also writes
`approval_policy="auto"` onto the slots and into the shared channel-trust mapping, and
`subagent_manager.admission.parent_trusted` reads *that policy* rather than any flag in
`safety_override` — so a revocation that stopped at the flag left `spawn_run`
auto-approved. `is_active` / `is_scope_active` / `renew_scoped` keep their policy check
as the fail-closed mask if that teardown was partial.

**Every refusal is SEL-audited.** A governance denial that leaves no trace is
indistinguishable from the request never having been made, which is exactly the
record an operator needs after an attempted escalation. The audit is best-effort at
each site: an SEL write failure never turns a refusal into a grant.

**The verdict is PUSHED at ceiling install, never polled.** Resolving the scope walks
the profiles dir (`iterdir` + per-file `stat`), and every consumer is on a path that
must not do that: `status_snapshot` is emitted on the 5s WebSocket push, `is_active` is
the predicate every transport hands to `TurnDriver` (so it runs per *tool call*), and
arming reaches the module from the event loop through synchronous callers. So
`approval_mode_permitted("yolo")` is resolved **once per ceiling**, by a hook
`safety_override` registers with `platform.context.register_ceiling_install_hook`.
`platform.context._install` is the single writer of the active context — central
distribution (`policy_distribution.apply_ceiling`), boot, the lazy default and the test
reset all go through it — so no ceiling escapes the hook. Every consumer
(`yolo_policy_permits()`, and `cached_disabled_approval_modes()` on top of it) is then a
bare attribute read: no TTL, no lock, no thread.

A governance-evaluation error at install time resolves to **denied**, and a process
that reads the verdict before any ceiling was installed resolves once through
`current_context()` — which composes and installs the standalone default, firing the
same hook. A host whose context refuses to compose (a governed profile whose boot did
not run) leaves the verdict denied, which is the fail-closed direction.

This replaced a pull-based cache — a 5s TTL plus a governance-generation stamp,
refreshed on a worker thread — and the reason is worth recording. Polling a value that
only changes on a discrete event needs a freshness key, a third
`unknown` verdict for the window before a refresh lands, and a per-caller rule for
collapsing that third state (approval had to fail closed on it; revocation had to *not*
fire, or an unrelated ceiling install would destroy a live grant permanently). Each of
those is a window in which a permit resolved under a retired ceiling is still served,
and the windows — not the scope, the arming gate or the audits — were where every
security finding against that design landed. Pushing removes them instead of shortening
them.

The denied set rides the shared `state.status_snapshot()` as
`disabled_approval_modes`. The picker **hides** each denied mode rather than showing
it disabled — a mode that cannot be chosen is simply absent, and `normal` keeps the
list from ever being empty. The one exception is a denied mode that is STILL THE
ACTIVE one: the trigger renders the active mode regardless, so hiding its row too
would put a label on the button with no matching row in the menu. That row stays,
disabled and labelled with the reason, until the user picks something else. The
Security panel lists the scope and its deny-list automatically —
`api_governance_policy` iterates `SCOPE_CATALOG` — so an operator can always see
which modes a policy removed.

**Not yet reached.** Auto-approval also enters through cron
`approval_mode: "auto"`, the messaging API's approval-mode field, subagent spawn, and
config `agent.approval_mode`. Those carry their own vocabulary and are tracked
separately from this scope — see the reserved `approval_mode` ordinal's
still-reserved note.

### Computer use is NOT governed (deliberately)

Computer use (see [computer-use.md](computer-use.md)) has **no scope rows in
`SCOPE_CATALOG`** and no governance decision anywhere in its dispatch path. That is
a product decision, not an oversight, and it is a reversal: an earlier revision
shipped eight rows here (`capabilities.computer_use`, `computer_use.actions`,
`.apps`, `.app_names`, `.observations`, `.targets`, `.approval`, and
`capabilities.computer_use_pointer`) plus two custom matchers (`bundle_id`,
`cu_action`). All of it was removed — neither matcher is registered, and naming
either one now aborts governance boot (see the `_MATCHERS` note above).

**What replaced it.** One operator opt-in on the keystone `computer_use.json`,
which `security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` fences the agent away from. The agent cannot
read or write that file, so it cannot enable its own desktop automation — and it
cannot drive KiroCrew's own window either (`computer_use/policy.py`), so it cannot
click the toggle in the UI. Those two facts are the entire boundary.

**What this costs, stated plainly.** There is no way to express "computer use is
allowed but only for Preview", "read-only desktop access", "never type into a
password field" (beyond the always-on floor), or "every action must be approved" as
policy. A fleet that needs any of those should not enable the feature. The
`mcp` scope still works as a blunt instrument: denying `@kirocrew-computer` removes
the tools entirely, which is the one governance lever that remains.

**If it is ever re-governed**, the rows belong back in this file's `SCOPE_CATALOG`
inline (never `register_scope()`d from the feature package): `load_security_policy()`
runs at boot before any feature import, and a policy naming an unregistered scope
raises "unknown governed key … (fail-closed)" — so a lazy registration would abort
boot on every governed host the day a fleet adds the row.

Two things computer use still shares with this module, neither of them a decision:

* `_CU_ACTION_CLASSES` — the code-owned `observe` / `mutate` / `pointer` /
  `keyboard` / `text_entry` / `control` labels. `hooks` reads them for the
  read-only auto-approve — the one live consumer. `gate.is_mutating_action` reads
  them too so "which verbs synthesize input" has one definition, but it currently has
  no caller in the package: it is retained as the accessor an edition would use
  rather than re-deriving the classes, not as a control on the dispatch path;
* `CU_MCP_SERVER` / `is_computer_use_title` — the server key and title prefix, used
  by `classify_tool_title` to route a computer-use title to the ordinary `mcp` pair.

## Audit

`sel.log_governance_decision` records a `governance_decision` event
(`outcome ∈ {allowed, denied}` — the existing permit vocabulary). The SEL writer
applies the baseline credential/exfiltration passes to `metadata` values and the
free-form top-level strings (`operation` / `resources` / `error`) before
persisting, but `redact_via_context` is broader than those passes — so the
operation / item / reason are ALSO redacted via `redact_via_context` **before**
`log`; the writer's pass is a second layer, not a replacement.

## CLI

`kirocrew policy {show | validate | explain <scope> <item> | profile <name>}` —
read-only operator diagnostics. `show` reports the ceiling's **proven** provenance
(`signed and verified` / `signed but UNVERIFIED` / `unsigned`) rather than a bare
issuer string. `explain` traces the rule/layer/reason and the live gate verdict. Deliberately **not** exposed as an MCP tool: it surfaces
governance internals that the agent (the governed subject) should not enumerate.

(The two `validate` warnings that used to be listed here were specific to the
computer-use `bundle_id` matcher and the `capabilities.computer_use` row, both of
which are gone.)

## Companion (separate package, separate CR)

The `amazon` companion contributes the restrictive posture as its
**bundled `security_policy.json`** (precedence step 3) rather than as code;
capability providers (Midway/SigV4/tunnels) and the SharePoint redaction
carve-out stay as code. It expects `CONTRACT_VERSION == 1` (pinned pre-launch).

unavailable dispositions, the live-refresh reject-and-keep path — and the three
controls on the cache itself — `TestAnExposedCacheIsStillReadOnly`,
`TestTheCachePairIsWrittenUnderOneLock` and
`TestAnUnverifiableSourceIsTreatedAsWritable`),
`test_sandbox_mount_checked.py` (that all six launcher mounts, including the
read-only bind and its sealing remount, refuse the spawn when they fail),
`test_governance_updates.py` (the
`updates` pins, the shared seam's fail-open-on-error disposition, and the
tracked-remote resolution), `test_agent_backend_governance.py` (the
`agent_backend` scope: the additive-over-floor semantics, the registry recompute
and its restore-on-loosening behaviour, the gateway-start binding contract and that
a runtime ceiling install deliberately does not re-derive the set, the
host-session binding, the both-directions audit, the fail-closed disposition, and
that no second gate exists), and `test_computer_use_gate.py` (that the
computer-use gate is audit-only and permits — see the section above).
