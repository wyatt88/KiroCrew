## LLM Provider Abstraction

Kiro Crew drives every LLM through one seam: the `LLMProvider` ABC in
`providers/base.py`. `AcpProvider` (`providers/acp.py`) is the only implementation
the factory selects; `AcpSessionProvider` (`acp/session_provider.py`) is a second
concrete subclass, the adapter a shared-runtime session is swapped onto once
`AcpRuntime` is up.
`agent.provider` is fixed to `"acp"` (enum `["acp"]`) — the provider is not the
harness selector. **Which harness that one provider drives is a separate
decision, taken from `agent_sdk/backends.py`**: `agent.acp_backend` names a backend id
and `BASELINE_SELECTABLE_BACKENDS` decides which ids an operator may choose.
Several are selectable on a plain public build, so "one provider" never meant
"one backend".

### Architecture

Private V2 process isolation is a trusted provider preparation decision. The
synchronous factory leaves identity reads to `AcpProvider.prepare_private_memory`,
which resolves persisted/protected session memory in a worker before `start`
chooses a runtime or starts a process. Session allocation also calls preparation
before its existing pre-start privacy comparison. The result updates provider
and client flags together on the event loop, removes shared MCP routing for a
private provider, and retains the original socket for private-path validation.
Successful preparation is reused by `start` and recovery; failure or cancellation
does not publish it. `private_memory=True` is preserved through `AcpProvider`,
`AcpClient` and `AcpRuntime`, including a recovery respawn. Caller extra kwargs and
environment variables cannot opt into or out of that decision. The actual sandbox
spawn applies the member-specific Global V1 masks
and refuses an unenforced mode; the earlier context check is not a substitute.
Private sessions bypass the global warm/shared runtime inventory. Dedicated
private consolidation uses the same preparation boundary; V1 factory call shapes
and background/pool behavior remain unchanged.

`agent_sdk/backends.py` is the selection authority: it defines the ids, the membership
floor (`ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`), the selectable baseline, and every capability set a
backend opts into. Do not re-describe that seam here —
[harness-parity.md](harness-parity.md) holds the invariants that keep the Kiro
path from being widened for an adapted harness,
[harness-onboarding.md](harness-onboarding.md) the sequence a new harness walks,
and [agent-host-contract.md](agent-host-contract.md) the host obligations every
adapted backend meets, KAS included, as a worked example. The transport itself (framing, timeouts, binary resolution,
config isolation) is [acp-client.md](acp-client.md); this file owns the
*interface*.

**Removed, and not to be re-added:** the Bedrock provider, the standalone
provider, their config fields, and the multi-provider dispatch factory. A second
`agent.provider` value would route around every harness-parity invariant, which
is why the enum stays closed.

The Claude Code harness has its own page: [claude-code-provider.md](claude-code-provider.md).


### LLMProvider ABC (`providers/base.py`)

`providers/base.py` is the surface, and it is the only honest copy of it — the
ABC declares roughly forty members, so a hand-maintained list here goes stale
without anything going red. Read the module.

The members that carry *contract* meaning, rather than plumbing, are the ones a
harness can get wrong:

| Member | Contract |
|---|---|
| `start` / `shutdown` / `stream` | The turn lifecycle every consumer depends on. |
| `approve_tool` / `reject_tool` | Tool-approval responses; a provider that cannot answer must still refuse, never hang. |
| `context_usage_pct`, `context_usage_unknown`, `context_window_tokens`, `context_used_tokens` | The context meter. `context_usage_unknown` is what distinguishes "0%" from "not measured". |
| `session_id`, `cleanup_session`, `cwd` | Session identity and cleanup routing; a wrong `cwd` persists the wrong workspace on resume. |
| `served_model`, `available_models` | The model actually served, which can differ from the id Crew stored. |
| `steer` / `supports_steer` / `last_steer_monotonic` | The steer extension. Non-implementers answer `-32601`, so `supports_steer` must be honest. |
| `has_active_turn`, `has_unfinished_turn`, `wait_turn_done` | Turn-state probes the session layer reads before reusing a process. |
| `is_session_sharing_eligible` | Whether one process may host multiplexed sessions. |
| `manual_compact_unsupported_backend`, `mcp_config_hot_reload`, `uses_kiro_identity_store` | Capability answers, each defaulting to the safe value so a Kiro path never needs a `hasattr` probe (harness-parity H14). |
| `member_capabilities_supported`, `loaded_capability_template` | Full member-spec support defaults to false and is granted only by `ACP_BACKENDS_MEMBER_CAPABILITIES` membership (harness-parity H6); the observed loaded template defaults to empty. Only a dedicated Kiro runtime with a confirmed active template provides evidence; the session layer also validates the saved version and MCP registration report before showing applied. |
| `billing_stats`, `child_fidelity_aware` | Accounting and subagent-fidelity reporting. |

### LLMEvent (`providers/base.py`)

Provider-agnostic event dataclass (aliased from `AcpEvent`):

| Kind | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `text_chunk` | Text output from agent |
| `thinking_chunk` | Extended thinking (Claude 3.7+) |
| `tool_call` | Tool invocation |
| `tool_result` | Tool output |
| `permission_request` | Tool approval request (ACP only) |
| `complete` | End of turn |
| `compaction_status` | Compaction result |
| `clear_status` | Clear display |
| `agent_switched` | Agent mode changed |
| `mcp_oauth_request` | MCP server needs OAuth (has `server_name`, `oauth_url`) |
| `mcp_server_initialized` | MCP server ready after OAuth (has `server_name`) |
| `mcp_server_init_failure` | MCP server OAuth/init failed (has `server_name`, `text`) |

Terminal events also carry `synthetic_completion`. It is false for a provider's
raw result frame and true when Kiro Crew fabricates a compatibility terminal
because the result frame never arrived; consumers that account completed work
must require the raw form.

### AcpProvider (`providers/acp.py`)

The one concrete provider. It spawns a long-lived harness subprocess — by default
`kiro-cli acp --agent <name>` — and speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio.

**The backend seam:** `AcpProvider`/`AcpClient` take an `acp_backend` id
(`""` → kiro-cli, `"claude"` → `claude-agent-acp`, `"kas"` → KAS,
`"codex"` → `codex-acp`). Construction rejects an id outside
`ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`, so a value that falls through every identity check cannot
spawn kiro-cli under a foreign label. Which of those ids an operator can select
is `BASELINE_SELECTABLE_BACKENDS`, not this file. Binary resolution and
config isolation per backend live in [`acp-client.md`](acp-client.md); do not add
a second provider or a provider-level selector (see the repo-root `CLAUDE.md`).

Adding an id to `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN` also obliges a frame-replay corpus under
`test/fixtures/acp_frames/<id>/`; the requirement and what it buys are stated once,
in [agent-host-contract.md](agent-host-contract.md).

**Key APIs:**
- `start()` → `AcpClient.ensure_ready()` (spawns process, handshake, session/new)
- `stream()` → maps events from `stream_events()`
- `stream_command()` → native slash command execution
- `approve_tool()`/`reject_tool()` → JSON-RPC response
- `context_usage_pct()` → reads `last_prompt_stats.context_pct`
- `context_window_tokens()` → reads `last_prompt_stats.context_window_tokens` (the real served window from `usage_update.size`, 0 if unknown). Used by the dashboard token text instead of re-deriving the window from the model id. A mid-session `set_model` (live switch on both `AcpClient` and `AcpSessionHandle`) rebases these stats via `AcpPromptStats.rebase_to_window`: the window is re-derived from `model_registry.model_window` (0 on a registry miss), `context_used_tokens` is kept, `context_pct` is recomputed and clamped, and `context_tokens_from_usage` is cleared so the next metadata `contextUsagePercentage` can backfill against the NEW model instead of being gated forever by the old model's `usage_update`. The dashboard model-switch endpoint then broadcasts one `context_usage` WS event with `reset: true` (both live-switch and session-reset paths, single and bulk), which lets the frontend reducer replace or delete its stored per-slot token counts — per-turn events without `reset` never delete. The post-compaction pct-0 broadcast carries the same flag.
- `compact()` → sends `/compact` via `send_command()`. The **dashboard's** manual `/compact` gates on `ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT` first, as a pre-acquisition local command: the live session's `manual_compact_unsupported_backend` capability property (declared on the `LLMProvider` ABC with a `None` (supported) default per harness-parity H14, answered by the ACP implementations from set membership) is peeked when a session exists, else the same `agent.acp_backend` config the factory would build one with — so a refused `/compact` behaves as if the turn never started (no session created, no Slack OPTIONS expired, no one-shot turn state consumed). The reply is informational — the backend manages compaction automatically, mirroring the `cc_managed` relationship — not an error: kiro-cli answers the prompt with `_kiro.dev/compaction/status` and claude-agent-acp compacts natively in-prompt, but KAS treats the prompt as ordinary text and never emits a status, so an ungated manual `/compact` would strand `wait_for_compaction()` for the full `COMPACT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS` (#7800). The **auto-compact** path consults the same capability from the compaction gate ladder (`session_compaction._compact_unsupported_backend`) and declines with `"compact_unsupported"` before the compaction task is scheduled, so no `/compact` is dispatched and the turn semaphore is never acquired — an ungated dispatch stranded the status wait for the whole `COMPACT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS` while HOLDING that semaphore and then recycled the session (#7812). The **messaging-surface** `/compact` commands (Slack, Telegram, Discord, Webex, Teams, Feishu, iMessage, WeCom, Weixin and WhatsApp) gate on the same capability through `messaging.commands.compact_unsupported_backend` before dispatching, answering with `compact_unsupported_reply` (translated on the Chinese-language surfaces, plain-voiced on iMessage and WhatsApp); their context-threshold notices decline silently on such a backend — no forced hard-threshold compaction to run, and no soft nudge whose `/compact` advice cannot work (#8156). Gating covers only command dispatch — KAS auto-summarization frames keep mapping to compaction status.
- `cancel()` → sends `session/cancel` notification
- `supports_effort()` / `change_effort(level)` / `clear_effort()` → reasoning-effort control (see below)
- `is_alive()` → `AcpClient.is_responsive()` (600s stale threshold)
- `is_process_alive()` → OS-level process check

**Reasoning effort** (Opus/Sonnet/Fable **and GPT-5.x** — shared vocabulary in `effort.py`: levels `low|medium|high|xhigh|max`, capability via `model_supports_effort`, resolution via `resolve_effort_for_model` with priority slot-override > workspace default > None). Capability is a conservative allowlist of known-capable families (`opus`/`sonnet`/`fable`/`gpt`, minus a hard `haiku` exclusion), verified against kiro-cli 2.12/2.13 over ACP — kiro rejects `/effort` on the other third-party models (deepseek/minimax/glm/qwen/auto) with "Effort configuration is currently not available on <model>". A new model family lands as unsupported until confirmed (safe default: the slider hides). Applied via a workspace `cli.json` overlay at `<work_dir>/.kiro/settings/cli.json` → `chat.modelDefaults.<model>.<key>.effort`, written before every spawn (`_write_cli_overlay`) and recovered on init (`_read_cli_overlay`) for server-restart resilience. The `<key>` sub-object is **family-specific** (`effort_settings_key`): `output_config` for Claude models, `reasoning` for GPT models — kiro silently ignores the wrong key, so a mismatched shape would survive a live push but drop on respawn. `_write_cli_overlay` removes stale effort from the other family key while preserving unrelated settings; `_clear_cli_overlay_effort`/`_read_cli_overlay` sweep both keys. Live change pushes `/effort` with the TuiCommand args form (`send_command(args={"level": …})`). The factory threads `reasoning_effort_override` → `effort_per_model[current_model]`; when a valid requested effort cannot be threaded on a cold start (the resolved model is empty or not effort-capable) the factory's gate logs one warning naming the level, the session, and the resolved model (or `auto` when unresolved, matching the spawn-side `effort_dropped` verdict) — reporting its own drop decision on surfaces that construct a fresh provider, an explicit `reasoning_effort_override` always warns (a caller's own dropped request is the event the gate exists to surface), while a drop sourced only from the config default (`agent.reasoning_effort`) is deduped once per (model, level) for the factory's lifetime so one static configuration fact does not repeat on every construction. A `reasoning_effort_override` on a warm-pool claim is applied post-claim via `provider.change_effort` (updating `_effort_per_model` and the `cli.json` overlay write) rather than bypassing the pool, recovering pool-hit startup latency; if the claimed model does not support effort, `change_effort` returns False and a corresponding drop warning is logged. The dashboard handler routes through `change_effort`/`clear_effort` and only resets the session when there is no live provider. Non-effort-capable models persist the slot value without a live apply or reset.

**MCP Tool Search** (kiro backend only — see https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/mcp/tool-search/): loads MCP tool specs on demand ("search-and-call") instead of sending every tool definition each turn, keeping the context window clear when many MCP servers are configured. Gated by the `agent.tool_search` config toggle (default **on**; auto-surfaces as a Settings toggle since the schema is generated from the dataclass).
- Applied via the **same** workspace `cli.json` overlay used for effort (`<work_dir>/.kiro/settings/cli.json`), written deterministically before every spawn and on each restart by `_write_tool_search_overlay` (called from `AcpProvider.__init__` and `start()`). When enabled it writes the flat keys `toolSearch.enabled=true` plus `toolSearch.minPct`/`toolSearch.minTokens`, taken from `agent.tool_search_min_pct` / `agent.tool_search_min_tokens` (defaults `5` / `50000`, mirroring kiro-cli's own thresholds; clamped to 0-100 and >= 0, non-numeric falls back to the default); when disabled it writes `toolSearch.enabled=false` and drops both thresholds.
- **Why the thresholds are not forced to 0:** deferral costs a round-trip — a deferred tool's spec is absent from the model's tool list, so the first direct call fails with `A tool with the name '<name>' does not exist` and has to be recovered with `tool_search`. That only pays once the specs are genuinely large, which is what the thresholds express (kiro-cli defers when EITHER is exceeded). An earlier build hard-coded both to `0`, imposing the round-trip on every install including ones far below the threshold. Setting both to `0` still restores unconditional deferral for operators who want it. The thresholds are written **explicitly** rather than omitted, so a machine carrying the old forced zeros is actually migrated instead of silently keeping them.
- Writing both `true` and `false` makes the KiroCrew toggle authoritative over any value in the user's global `~/.kiro/settings/cli.json`. The write is merge-safe with the effort `chat.modelDefaults` keys in the same file.
- **Non-kiro backends** — no-op. Tool Search is a kiro-cli feature; `_apply_tool_search_overlay` returns early when the backend does not read the overlay and when no toggle value was threaded in (`tool_search is None`).
- **Native-resume compatibility:** for a direct dashboard turn with Tool Search enabled (dashboard session identity and no resumable linked-channel identity), the kiro backend does not use `session/load`. Before provider acquisition, dashboard chat resolves the slot's dedicated Slack field unconditionally and uses the channel-neutral `SessionMap.mirror` link only when `mirror_accepts_inbound` is true. Thus inbound-capable Telegram/Discord links remain distinguishable when they reuse a `dashboard:*` key after restart, while outbound-only iMessage/WhatsApp mirrors still take the direct-dashboard recovery path. A loaded transcript can return without Tool Search's activated schemas: `tool_search` reports a match, but the next inference still cannot invoke that tool. The provider instead creates a fresh native session and sets `_history_replay_needed`, so `SessionManager` marks conversation replay pending against the rebuilt tool registry. Only this direct-dashboard compatibility branch also makes `defer_replay_sid_promotion` true; `SessionMap` keeps the prior full-history SID durable while that lease is pending, allocation does not publish the fresh SID yet, and `close_all()` refuses to overwrite the retained mapping while `provider_switch_replay` remains armed. Generic `session/load` recovery still requests history replay but publishes its fresh SID immediately because non-dashboard dispatchers do not own the dashboard settlement contract; a later channel restart therefore resumes the recovered native transcript rather than the stale pre-recovery SID. Replay settlement runs from the dashboard turn's `finally`, so exceptions, task cancellation, early returns, and synthetic terminals cannot bypass it. A landed, non-synthetic replay-bearing `end_turn` promotes the fresh SID, as does confirmed `/clear` after native history deletion. Cancellation, incomplete streams, and every other non-committed terminal leave the prior SID in place and re-arm replay, so a second gateway restart cannot strand a slash-only or discarded transcript. That lease drives every replayable dashboard session-start prompt block (history, ContextBuilder, member context, folder, persona, and context telemetry). `AgentSpawn` hooks remain keyed to the actual provider spawn so script side effects execute once; a slash-first turn does not re-fire them during replay. Non-destructive native slash commands bypass `ContextBuilder` and leave the lease intact; a confirmed `/clear` consumes it at `EVENT_CLEAR_STATUS` so later replay cannot restore deleted history. Authorization, shutdown, or pre-dispatch Stop aborts preserve it. Async stream creation is not acceptance: a replay-bearing non-slash turn records acceptance in runner-local state only when its stream yields the first provider event, while the shared lease remains armed throughout the in-flight turn. Empty streams and pre-output failures therefore retain replay without settlement, and a concurrent shutdown can observe only the still-pending old SID. Final settlement synchronously promotes the fresh SID and consumes the lease only for a landed, non-synthetic, non-empty `end_turn`; every empty-response verdict is unlanded for replay durability, including the terminal give-up rung when retry budget is exhausted or auto-continue is disabled. If an accepted turn ends cancelled, the still-armed lease carries forward because kiro-cli discards that turn; the next prompt receives the full older replay plus its cancelled-turn preamble. This trades the native resume latency win for a usable dashboard tool surface without losing prior conversation or undoing an explicit clear. Setting `agent.tool_search=false` keeps dashboard-native `session/load`; a dashboard-keyed resumable channel turn and every channel dispatcher remain on native resume regardless of Tool Search.

- **Resume guard:** `session/load` (resume) is only attempted when Tool Search is disabled and the prior session transcript exists on disk (`~/.kiro/sessions/cli/<sid>.json`). A stale persisted sid with no transcript falls back to `session/new`, preventing a fresh conversation from replaying old turns (which inflated base context).
- **Working dir:** `AcpProvider.cwd` overrides the `LLMProvider` ABC default so `session_map` persists the real workspace path. AcpProvider's work_dir lives on the inner client (`_client._work_dir`), so a consumer reading `_work_dir` off the provider gets `""` for every ACP session; `provider.cwd` is the member to read.

### Config (`config/loader.py`)

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "provider": "acp",
    "model": "auto"
  }
}
```

- `agent.provider` is fixed to `"acp"` (enum `["acp"]`); the provider is not a choice.
- `agent.acp_backend` is the harness choice, resolved through `agent_sdk.backends.resolve_selected_backend` (the top-level `acp_backends` module is a re-export shim kept for existing call sites).
- `create_provider_factory()` returns a `Callable` that builds an `AcpProvider` for the resolved backend.

An agent spec's model is consumed by kiro-cli before Kiro Crew reaches
`session/new`, so the live-session entitlement guard cannot diagnose a wrong
wire spelling at spawn time. Agent create/update validate a pin before
persisting it: they reuse the role-model validator for advertised ids and
`model_registry.acp_id_correction` for the offline positive case where the
registry recognizes a non-ACP spelling and can name its ACP id. Unknown ids are
allowed because they may be valid regional or newly released ids; empty and
`auto` continue to defer. Doctor applies the same correction audit to every
discoverable user- and project-scoped spec.

### MCP Server Registration

MCP servers are passed directly in the `session/new` params. The two managed
servers (`kirocrew-core`, `kirocrew-cron` — see `agent.py:_MANAGED_MCP_SERVERS`)
are always present; user-configured servers from the agent config are merged in.

### SessionManager (`session.py`)

- Provider-agnostic via factory (one provider, `AcpProvider`, over the resolved backend)
- Calls `repair_agent_configs()` on gateway startup and periodically
- Resume: calls `set_resume_session_id()` before `start()`

### Subagent Approval Mode Inheritance (`subagent.py`)

Subagents inherit the global `approval_mode=auto` config as a final fallback when:
1. No parent session key exists (spawned independently), OR
2. Parent session key exists but the session is no longer in the store (garbage-collected)

If the parent session is alive but returned no policy, deny-by-default applies — the session is intentionally non-auto. This ensures subagents spawned from dashboard sessions still get auto-approval even if the parent session is GC'd before the subagent executes.

### Automatic recovery

Provider-level recovery mechanisms that fire automatically without user intervention:

**Interactive transient-5xx retry:** the interactive dashboard/Slack `chat_runner` stream loop retries a transient backend 5xx (InternalServerError / DispatchFailure / ConnectionReset, JSON-RPC `-32603`) through the shared `llm_helpers` transient classifier + backoff, **without** resetting the still-alive session. Auth/validation errors are excluded (fail-fast); on retry-budget exhaustion a clean error surfaces on a still-resumable session. The unattended `stream_and_collect` path retries on the same classifier, so both callers behave alike.

A transient 5xx that arrives *after* the turn already emitted output (the `_turn_emitted` guard is set once any assistant token streams or a tool call fires) no longer drops the turn. Instead it **RECOVERS ONCE**: the streamed partial is preserved as a finalized assistant message, a brief recovery notice is appended, and a *continue* instruction (not the original prompt) is re-queued onto the SAME live ACP session — which still holds the interrupted turn's context (original prompt, streamed partial, and any completed tool results) — so the model resumes from where it stopped rather than restarting. The recovery is one-shot per genuine user turn: the allowance is consumed only when a recovery is actually enqueued and is refreshed at the start of the next real user turn, never on the synthetic recovery turn, so a repeated post-token 5xx during recovery surfaces a clean error instead of looping. When Stop is active or the turn is nested (`_prompt_depth != 0`) the partial + notice are still shown but nothing is re-queued (the allowance is left unconsumed). This recovery **also applies to turns that already fired a tool call** — an ACCEPTED TRADEOFF (owner decision), rather than failing fast: a mid-stream 5xx is rare, and the continue instruction tells the model to resume and not re-run tools that already completed. A residual double-execution risk remains only for a side-effecting/destructive tool that was still *in flight* when the 5xx hit; the owner accepts that narrow risk in favor of recovering the turn.

**Compaction-failure notice backoff** (dashboard-chat; `dashboard/chat_utils._broadcast_compaction_result`): repeated per-turn compaction failures are collapsed rather than repeated. Per slot, `_compaction_fail_streak` counts consecutive failures and the first `_COMPACTION_NOTICE_SHOW_FIRST_N` (=2) are shown verbatim ("❌ Compaction failed: …"); further failures within the `_COMPACTION_FAIL_COOLDOWN_SECS` (60s) `_compaction_fail_cooldown_until` window are suppressed, and when the cooldown elapses a single collapsed "failed Nx in a row … Consider `/compact` manually" message is shown with `/compact` guidance. A `completed` status resets the streak/cooldown. `acp/client.py:_handle_compaction_status` logs the raw failed-compaction notification params at WARNING (kiro-cli carries no dedicated error field on failure). This is a UX/spam guard only — the underlying compaction still runs every turn on kiro-cli's schedule — and is distinct from SessionManager's proactive auto-compact cooldown.

**Compaction resets — then accurately re-reports — the context meter**: a `completed` `_kiro.dev/compaction/status` drops the stale token stats at the provider chokepoints — `AcpClient._handle_compaction_status` (every dispatch loop plus `wait_for_compaction`) and the mirrored sites in `AcpSessionHandle` (prompt dispatch loop and its `wait_for_compaction` queue-drain path) — via `AcpPromptStats.reset_after_compaction()`: `context_used_tokens`/`context_pct` zero out and `context_tokens_from_usage` clears (so fresh metadata can re-derive instead of being gated by the pre-compaction `usage_update`), while `context_window_tokens` is kept (the model did not change, so the served window still holds). kiro-cli then emits a fresh `_kiro.dev/metadata` with the real post-compaction `contextUsagePercentage` about a second after the completed status (live-probe confirmed), so `wait_for_compaction` grace-drains up to `_POST_COMPACTION_METADATA_GRACE_SECS` (5s) for it on `AcpClient`, `AcpSessionHandle`, and `AcpProvider`'s cached mid-turn result path (which delegates to the inner client via the `AcpSessionProvider` pass-through); the drain only ends on a metadata frame actually carrying a `contextUsagePercentage` (a credits-only frame is consumed but does not end it), re-queues non-metadata frames before any poison sentinel, and lets process death (`AcpError`) propagate; `_backfill_context_window` prefers the **kept served window** over the model registry when deriving tokens from that percentage, since the served size can differ from the static entry (e.g. opus served at [1m] vs a 200K registry row). The dashboard's manual `/compact` path then broadcasts the REAL post-compaction numbers when the drain captured them, and only falls back to `context_usage {pct: 0, reset: true}` (the same contract as the threshold auto-compact callback and the in-turn `_broadcast_compaction_result` chokepoint) when no metadata arrived — the meter then self-corrects on the next turn's telemetry. A failed/timed-out compaction leaves the counts untouched and re-sends them as-is. `_context_usage_payload` treats `used == 0` with a known window as "not measured yet" and omits the token fields, so the unconditional end-of-turn broadcast cannot overwrite a reset with a false "0 / W tokens" claim.

### Installation

KiroCrew drives `kiro-cli` over ACP — install it per its own docs, ensure it is
on `PATH`, and run `kiro-cli login`. `kirocrew doctor` reports its status.


## AcpProvider: shared-runtime startup

`AcpProvider.start()` branches on the backend. Every shared-runtime branch below
enters the same `AcpRuntime.spawn()` cold-start coordinator (default 2 concurrent
spawn+initialize handshakes per gateway loop); admission is backend-neutral, so an
adapted runtime harness neither bypasses the bound nor changes the Kiro path.

- **A runtime backend (`is_acp_runtime_backend`, i.e. membership in
  `acp_runtime_backends()`)** → `_start_kiro_runtime()`. This spawns an
  `AcpRuntime` (carrying the provider's sandbox mode, extra env, and MCP-gateway
  overlay/socket), resumes via `runtime.load_session()` when a prior transcript
  exists or otherwise `runtime.create_session()`, applies the configured model,
  and replaces `self._client` with an `AcpSessionProvider` (which implements the
  same interface as `AcpClient`, so downstream callers are unchanged). Any
  failure after `spawn()` kills the runtime so a half-initialised session never
  leaks an orphaned `kiro-cli`.

  This path refuses pooled MCP servers it cannot project.
  `AcpRuntime._refuse_unprojected_pooled_servers` raises the non-retryable
  `AcpToolGateUnroutable` — before `session/new`, so there is no session to tear
  down — when `pooled_session_servers` returns a non-empty array for a backend
  whose MCP surface is reached through an agent-config mirror
  (`providers.mirrors.registry.has_mirror`). The reason is that the mirror's
  `session_projection` is what withholds a pooled stub the agent's `tools` never
  references and what returns the per-tool deny set the client enforces at the
  approval request, and it runs only on the `AcpClient` path; a mirrored host
  approves its own tools internally, so an unprojected stub would be a live tool
  surface Crew never granted. The gate reads the registry rather than naming a
  backend, so a future mirrored host on this runtime inherits the refusal instead
  of the gap. `has_mirror` is False for kiro and KAS, which reach their servers
  natively, so their paths are untouched. Carrying the projection onto this path
  is what lifts the refusal.
- **A non-runtime backend (not a member)** → `AcpClient.ensure_ready()`, one
  process per session with no shared runtime. The branch is expressed as
  positive membership, not `not is_claude_backend`, so a harness added later
  does not inherit the kiro-family path (harness-parity H5).

`acp_runtime_backends()` and not the frozenset itself is what the FOREGROUND start
path reads (`AcpProvider.is_acp_runtime_backend`, its only consumer). The
background path (`session._bg_runtime_backends`) reads the frozenset on purpose,
so the switch does not reach it — see `session.md`, "Multiplexed _bg runtime". It
returns `ACP_BACKENDS_ACP_RUNTIME` verbatim unless `KIROCREW_CODEX_ACP_RUNTIME` is
set to `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`, which adds codex for the life of that process. The
switch is a preview and is **off** by default: it exists so codex's `AcpRuntime`
path can be exercised before the membership itself changes, and the frozenset
stays the shipped answer. A future harness author looking for "the one gate" is
looking for that function; the set is vocabulary, and `harness_for()` serves a
host whether or not the switch names it.

`AcpProvider.is_session_sharing_eligible` is membership in
`ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_SHARING` (harness-parity H6), not `not is_claude_backend`:
a capability granted by the absence of one backend is inherited by every backend
added later. It is what `SessionManager.is_session_sharing_eligible()` consults
to decide whether a parent session can host multiplexed subagent sessions. The
invariants governing what an added harness may and may not change are in
[harness-parity.md](harness-parity.md).
