# Config Module

## Overview

Foreign-agent onboarding is gated independently by `dashboard.import_onboarded`,
migrated from the older `dashboard.onboarded`, and the settings it projects are
merged strictly (merge-only, never a wholesale replace). The loader preserves legacy
numeric strings and integral floats already present in a config file, while rejecting
booleans and non-integral, malformed, or non-finite values. Imported settings are
type-validated before they are written, and the CLI converts typed values before
writing.

The config package loads runtime configuration from `~/.kiro/crew/config.json`
using stdlib dataclasses with sensible defaults. Responsibilities are split in
one direction: `config/sections.py` owns section DTOs, field defaults, and their
coercion/normalization rules; `config/resolution.py` owns raw overlay merging,
top-level section classification, and degraded-input tracking; and
`config/loader.py` owns the compatibility facade plus persistence, validation
orchestration, cache fingerprinting, migration, and runtime binding resolution.
`loader.py` re-exports the historical DTO, helper, and constant names so existing
callers keep the same import surface.
New section constants, including local speech's automatic-language default, are
read from `config.sections` directly; they do not expand that historical facade.

A feature whose section spends tokens on the user's behalf defaults to off and
documents its knobs in its own spec — `session_summary` is the current example
(see [session-summary.md](session-summary.md)), following the shape
`SkillsConfig` established: every field carries `_meta` label/help for the config
surfaces, out-of-range values are clamped with a warning rather than raising, and
a malformed section degrades to defaults so a hand-edited file cannot prevent the
gateway from starting.

## Data Home Location

KiroCrew's data root nests **under kiro-cli's own `~/.kiro/` base** so all
Kiro-family apps share a single directory a user can secure. `config_dir()`
(in `kiro_crew/config/paths.py`, re-exported from `kiro_crew/config/loader.py`)
is the single accessor and resolves to:

1. `$KIROCREW_HOME` when set (used as-is; refuses system directories like `/`,
   `/usr`, `/System`, `/etc`), else
2. `~/.kiro/crew` (the default).

**No migration — net-new users only.** All supported installs start directly in
`~/.kiro/crew`; there is no `~/.kirocrew` to relocate, so `config_dir()` simply
resolves and `mkdir`s the home above. The one-time `~/.kirocrew` → `~/.kiro/crew`
data-home migration that earlier releases carried has been **removed** (see
`docs/system-specs/post-launch-removals.md`). A leftover top-level `~/.kirocrew`
from an old install is never read, migrated, or deleted; it is left in place —
still credential-gated by the `.kirocrew` security-path spelling — and `kirocrew
doctor` reports it, warning rather than advising deletion when it still holds a
virtual environment (`venv`/`.venv`/`venvs`), since that may be the running
interpreter.

**Repository-controlled uninstall contract.** Every uninstall path owned by this
repository preserves the KiroCrew data home by default. `kirocrew service
uninstall` removes only its service definition; the Python/npm packages define
no uninstall lifecycle hook; and the desktop shell's generated NSIS uninstaller
removes only installed program state: its install directory, shortcuts,
channel-scoped updater cache, and any legacy “start with Windows” registry entry
(`deleteAppDataOnUninstall` stays false), without
resolving or removing the KiroCrew home. App Kit uninstall also preserves the
app's `data/` subtree unless the dedicated `purge_data=true` API action (CLI
`--purge-data`, or an explicit dashboard choice) is supplied. The API checks
for the literal boolean `true`; absent, legacy, or malformed values fail closed
to preservation. A whole-home purge is never coupled to uninstall.

**Uninstaller consideration (external dependency).** Because the data home now
lives under `~/.kiro/`, a hypothetical Kiro-family uninstaller that removes
`~/.kiro/` would also remove `~/.kiro/crew` and take KiroCrew's data — config,
credentials, memory DB, session history, and the SEL audit chain — with it. This
is a persisted-data one-way door, and — unlike when an archived rollback copy
existed — there is now no `~/.kirocrew.archived` fallback for ANY install
(upgrader or fresh), so such a wipe is unrecoverable total data loss.

Any Kiro-family uninstaller spec **MUST** either explicitly exclude
`~/.kiro/crew` from a `~/.kiro/`-wide wipe, or prompt before deleting it.
Independently, a user who wants the data home entirely outside `~/.kiro/` can set
`KIROCREW_HOME` to relocate it.

**Technical hedge — recovery-pointer breadcrumb.** `config_dir()` writes a small,
non-secret `~/.kirocrew.breadcrumb` pointer file at the top-level home
(`RECOVERY_BREADCRUMB_NAME`), deliberately **outside** `~/.kiro/`, recording the
data-home path (see `_write_recovery_breadcrumb`). It is idempotent where the
platform can check safely (on POSIX the prior content is read via `O_NOFOLLOW`
and rewritten only when the recorded path changes; where that flag is missing —
Windows — the check is skipped and the file is atomically rewritten once per
process), best-effort (never blocks startup), and
written only on the default path (a `KIROCREW_HOME` override carries no `~/.kiro/`
wipe risk). It is **not a backup** — just a durable signpost that survives a
`~/.kiro/`-wide uninstaller wipe so a user or support script can find any
surviving data or understand what was removed. This narrows, but does not
eliminate, the one-way-door risk above; the release gate still stands.

**Paths are resolved per call, never captured at import.** Because
`config_dir()` re-reads `$KIROCREW_HOME` on every call and the migration above
is deliberately lazy, the resolved value is only correct at the moment it is
needed. Modules therefore MUST NOT bind a path factory result to a module-level
constant:

```python
_SOME_DIR = config_dir() / "some"        # WRONG -- frozen at import
```

An import-time binding captures whatever home was active when the module was
first imported, which breaks two things at once: pod isolation (a pod exports
its own `KIROCREW_HOME`) and test isolation — `conftest.py`'s autouse `_isolate_kirocrew_home`
fixture runs *after* collection has already imported the module under test, so
it cannot reach a frozen constant. That last hole let a local test run write
2128 fixture rows into an operator's real usage store.

The required shape keeps the module-level name as an explicit opt-in override
(`None` = resolve live), so existing `monkeypatch.setattr(mod, "_SOME_DIR", tmp)`
call sites keep working:

```python
_SOME_DIR: Path | None = None

def _some_dir() -> Path:
    return _SOME_DIR if _SOME_DIR is not None else config_dir() / "some"
```

Annotating the override as `Path | None` is load-bearing: any consumer that
still reads the constant directly becomes a **mypy error** rather than a silent
`None` at runtime. This is enforced repo-wide by
`test/test_lazy_data_home_paths.py`, which walks the AST of `src/kiro_crew` for
module-level assignments calling any factory declared in `config/paths.py` and
fails on every hit. The factory list is derived from `paths.py` itself, so a
newly added factory is covered without editing the test. Issue #874.

**`config_dir()` maintains; `data_home()` only resolves.** `config_dir()` is
*resolve + maintain*: besides resolving the home it `mkdir`s it and refreshes the
recovery breadcrumb (a stat + a read). That work belongs to process start —
`ensure_data_home()` is the startup hook — and the distinction did not matter
while callers froze the result in a module constant, because the maintenance
then ran exactly once, at import.

Resolving per call makes it load-bearing: a request handler would otherwise
refresh the breadcrumb **on the event loop** as a side effect of asking where a
directory is. So the accessors above call **`data_home()`**:

| branch | behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| a **valid** `KIROCREW_HOME` override | delegates to `config_dir()` every call, so an override set *after* import is honoured. That branch performs no breadcrumb refresh — only a cheap `mkdir`. |
| default home already resolved | returns the cached `_resolved_home` directly — no `mkdir`, no breadcrumb. |
| not yet resolved | delegates to `config_dir()`, so the **first** resolution in a process creates the home and refreshes the breadcrumb once. |

The first row tests `_valid_override_home()` — the **same predicate `config_dir()`
gates on**, not merely "is the env var set". An override naming a system
directory (`/`, `/usr`, …) is rejected there and resolution falls through to the
default home, so gating on the raw env var would send every call down the
maintenance path for anyone with a bad override. The two predicates must not
drift apart; a regression test pins both directions.

`data_home()` keeps no cache of its own — the override branch must stay live, and
the cached branch reads the same `_resolved_home` that `config_dir()` populates,
so there is one source of truth for the location.

Existing direct `config_dir()` callers are unchanged and keep the maintenance
behaviour, including 25 pre-existing calls that already sit inside async
handlers.

## Workspace Root

`workspace_root()` returns the base directory for all LLM working directories (kiro-cli cwd, task runner output, etc.):

Resolution order:
1. `KIROCREW_WORKSPACE` env var — used as-is (no `kirocrew-workspace` subdirectory appended)
2. Saved path in `~/.kiro/crew/workspace_dir` (written by `kirocrew setup`; re-running setup preserves the existing value as the prompt default)
3. Platform default:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `/Volumes/workplace/kirocrew-workspace` (falls back to `~/workplace/kirocrew-workspace` if `/Volumes/workplace` doesn't exist) |
| Linux | `~/workplace/kirocrew-workspace` |

Each session/task gets an isolated subdirectory under this root via `_session_work_dir(key)`:
- Chat sessions: `kirocrew-workspace/cli_chat`, `kirocrew-workspace/{thread_ts}`
- Background: `kirocrew-workspace/_bg`
- Cron: `kirocrew-workspace/cron_{job_id}`
- TaskRunner: `kirocrew-workspace/taskrunner_main`
- Background session: `kirocrew-workspace/_bg`

The parent directory is created on first call if it doesn't exist.

## Project Directory Resolution

`KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR` env var controls where agent config and skills are loaded from:

1. Env var `KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR` (if set and valid)
2. CWD walk-up — CLI walks up from CWD looking for `skills/` + `src/kiro_crew/` (the `agents/` dir was removed in commit bbbc1f6e when agent config moved into `src/kiro_crew/config/`)
3. Saved path in `~/.kiro/crew/project_dir` (written by `kirocrew setup`)
4. Bundled fallback — `config/defaults.json` and `builtin_skills/` inside the package

The CLI (`cli.py:main()`) auto-detects and sets the env var at startup.

## Named Memory Stores (`memory_stores.py`)

The reserved `agents.default` assistant uses the existing Global Memory **V1**.
Every new named `agents` entry receives one private **V2** memory store. Existing
members retain their exact V1 binding until the owner chooses V2. Changing
`default_agent` selects the member with its existing memory version and binding;
it never converts private memory to Global. A materialized provider template which
is not a Crew Member continues to use V1.

### Separate files preserve V1

| Resolver | Global `default` | Private named store |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_store_dir_for` | `<home>/workspace/` | `<home>/memory_stores/<name>/` |
| `resolve_store_path` | `<home>/memory.db` | `<home>/memory_stores/<name>/memory.db` |
| `memory_index_path_for` | `<home>/memory_index.db` | `<home>/memory_stores/<name>/memory_index.db` |

The markdown root contains `memory/preferences.md`, `memory/projects.md` and
`memory/history/`. It is not the default vector/index directory. No path is
renamed and no V1 data is migrated, copied or algorithmically converted on member
creation. Private stores begin empty. Explicit selected-content inheritance and
its provenance are owned by [memory-skills-hooks](memory-skills-hooks.md).

### Private ownership and creation

`MemoryStoreConfig.owner_member` identifies the sole owning config alias;
`memory_version` is `2` for private member stores, and defaults to `1` for legacy
or manually declared stores. A private store also has a bounded
`member-memory.json` manifest with the same owner and version. Runtime resolution
checks both records and refuses a store bound by any other member.

`provision_member_memory(config, member)` allocates an exclusive random directory
named `member-<slug>-<uuid>`, writes the ownership manifest, initializes an empty V2
SQLite database, then updates the loaded config. The member is published only
after initialization succeeds. Directory creation uses `exist_ok=False`, so neither concurrent creations
nor a reused display name can adopt another directory's contents. Parent and
child directories receive owner-only permissions. It never resets an existing
private store or copies the former binding's data.

`POST /api/agents` and `kirocrew agent create` provision automatically; installed
agent sync provisions newly discovered members too. An absent, empty or `default`
create field is accepted for client compatibility and requests automatic private
allocation. A supplied named store is rejected. `PUT /api/agents/{name}` and CLI
update reject rebinding: an echoed current store is accepted, another identity
(including global) is not.

The typed `memory.private_provisioning_enabled` boolean defaults to true. The
existing owner config PATCH API accepts only JSON booleans; the loader normalizes
a present malformed value to false before advisory schema validation, including
when jsonschema is unavailable. False pauses new member allocation and V1 opt-in
through the common creation guard. It leaves existing store execution and
management unchanged and does not cancel previously admitted work. The setting
is read at admission, so changes need no gateway restart. See
[memory-skills-hooks](memory-skills-hooks.md) for its scope and refusal contract.
The creation guard also refuses degraded `memory` and `DEGRADED_WHOLE_CONFIG`
markers rather than interpreting their default values as provisioning permission.

Legacy members keep working with their exact Global or declared unowned V1
binding. They may opt in to empty V2 memory through `PUT /api/agents/{name}` with
`provision_memory: true`, or `kirocrew agent update <name> --provision-memory`.
Their previous Global or named memory remains untouched. Unchanged legacy
bindings permit unrelated metadata edits, including description and avatar.
Broken existing V2 ownership requires recovery instead of another allocation.

An actual dashboard V1-to-V2 opt-in returns `new_conversation_required: true`.
The owner must finish or stop visible member work and its attached children
before setup. Idle providers are closed, and their conversation identities keep
the original V1 store. Opening the member then selects a fresh V2 conversation;
old V1 transcripts and native provider context are never relabeled as V2.
The same private-assignment check runs before provider allocation, including
after CLI opt-in. Existing schedules and child runs retain their recorded store.

Member create/update publish only the member and its store record through
`persist_member_config` and the cross-process `update_config_locked` primitive.
The write rechecks duplicate creation, expected prior binding and ownership under
the lock, retaining unrelated settings written by another caller. A failed or
competing publication may leave an unreferenced empty store; it cannot expose
it as a member's memory. The existing installed-agent sync remains a batch config
save and is serialized with dashboard config edits by the handler lock.

### Exact resolution and explicit failures

`resolve_declared_store` either returns the requested declared name or raises
`UnknownMemoryStore`. There is no named-store fallback to `default_memory_store`
or to V1. `default_memory_store` remains readable for config compatibility but is
not a repair target for private memory.

`require_memory_store(store, config=..., require_directory=True)` additionally opens
the directory and validates V2 ownership and the existing SQLite file header.
A deleted/unreadable directory or database is an error, not permission to
recreate empty memory. `require_member_memory_store`
accepts the member's exact declared V1 identity or its uniquely owned V2 identity.
Legacy admission checks surviving private declarations, member manifests and
owner metadata in unmanifested regular SQLite files;
named V1 stores must contain no private manifest or database identity. A damaged
generated private-store name is a refusal hint, never authority to adopt a store.
Protected V2 conversation records also prevent a config change from downgrading
that conversation before provider allocation. Unknown or malformed bindings
refuse. Callers propagate these failures rather than treating them as absent.

`resolve_agent_identity` is a metadata-only helper for member labels and model
display; it grants no memory access. Sandboxed MCP advisory selection calls
`resolve_agent_bindings(..., validate_memory_files=False)` because member files
are hidden there. The flag skips member-directory scans and database validation
while retaining config ownership checks and the named-store retirement gate.
It grants no execution authority. Trusted gateway execution uses strict file
validation off the event loop before accepting the selected member.

Store names are lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, 1–80 characters, with no
leading/trailing hyphen, path separators, Windows device basename, trailing dot or
space. Malformed config declarations are reported and preserved; no sanitization
can silently merge identities. Composed paths are checked for exact identity
under `memory_stores/`, refusing links to either a sibling or an external store.

`memory_store_version(store)` reads only the bounded ownership manifest without
loading config, so vector initialization can positively select V2 algorithms.
Global, unrecognized and unowned legacy stores answer `1`. This version query is
not an authorization gate; execution still validates the config binding.

The entire `memory_stores/` subtree is read/write fenced from agent file tools.
See [security](security.md) for the enforced boundary and shell-access limits,
and [memory-skills-hooks](memory-skills-hooks.md#memory-across-surfaces-and-channels)
for how trusted execution carries the member binding.

## Workspace fall-through is logged

`workspace_dir_for(name)` also reads the LOADED config's `workspaces` table rather
than the raw bytes, so it and `resolve_agent_bindings` cannot answer the same
question two ways. An unmapped name falls back to `default_workspace` and then to
`WorkspaceConfig().dir`, and the fall-through is logged: two DISTINCT names both
resolving to `<home>/workspace` warns, because that is how a workspace split becomes
a shared tree nobody notices. An install that simply has no `workspaces` section is
the ordinary fresh state and logs at debug. It **never raises** —
`default_project_dir` and the workspace-identity block are built on it, so a raise
would break a fresh install and take both with it.

Consequence worth knowing: a legacy FLAT `{"name": "dir"}` workspaces entry is a
type mismatch the schema validator removes before the loader sees it, so such an
entry is absent from the loaded table. `resolve_agent_bindings` has always answered
from that table; `workspace_dir_for` now agrees with it.

## Superseded Defaults (reported; a named few adopt themselves once)

`config.json` is a full materialization of the schema -- every field is written to
disk, including fields the operator never set -- and each field is resolved as
`data.get(key, DEFAULT)`. A stored value therefore always beats the dataclass
default, so **changing a shipped default reaches only installs created after the
change**; a pre-existing install keeps whatever value was materialized last.

`config/superseded_defaults.py` holds an append-only registry
(`SUPERSEDED_DEFAULTS`) of default changes existing installs should be told about,
each entry naming the dotted key, the old default, the new default, and the
release that changed it. `superseded_default_drift(base_data)` returns the entries
whose stored value equals the old default, comparing type as well as value so a
stored `0` is not read as `False`.

Registered so far: `mcp_gateway.forward_declared_env` (False -> True, #4566),
`session.autocompact_pct` (90.0 -> 70.0, #4388), `stt.streaming` (False -> True,
0.5.0), `stt.model` ("turbo" -> "base", 0.5.0),
`dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs` (25 -> unset, #6651),
`instances.warm_set_cap` (5 -> 0, #7248),
`agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs` (7200 -> 14400, #8949) and
`agent.subagent_timeout_secs` (1800 -> 10800, #8891). **Two** carry `auto_adopt` --
the agent timeout budgets -- and the other six are report-only; see below.

### Auto-adoption, and the line it does not cross

Reporting is the right answer only while the two readings of a stored value are
indistinguishable AND holding the old value is survivable. On the two agent timeout
budgets neither holds: an install carrying `agent.subagent_timeout_secs: 1800` reaps
every subagent at 30 minutes on a build whose default is 10800, and its operator
sees timeouts instead of results having never chosen 1800. The existing mechanism's
only answer was a CLI command they have no reason to know exists.

So `SupersededDefault.auto_adopt` opts ONE entry into a one-shot rewrite. What keeps
the set small is **not** a judgment about how wide the value's range is. That
criterion was tried and is wrong: `instances.warm_set_cap` is numeric with a range,
and an operator running five crews who types 5 stores exactly the old default. The
line that holds is whether the repository ALREADY PINS the stored value as a
supported configuration:

| Key | | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|
| `agent.subagent_timeout_secs` | adopts | -- |
| `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs` | adopts | -- |
| `session.autocompact_pct` | reports | `test_a_persisted_ceiling_value_is_left_alone` |
| `dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs` | reports | `test_explicit_desktop_default_is_preserved_for_managed_service` |
| `stt.streaming` | reports | `test_put_persists_streaming` |
| `mcp_gateway.forward_declared_env` | reports | `test_a_real_false_still_turns_it_off` |
| `stt.model` | reports | a picker value; adopting changes transcription accuracy |
| `instances.warm_set_cap` | reports | 5 is an ordinary deliberate cap |

A row whose old value another suite guarantees is not stale noise by definition,
whatever its type. `test_only_unpinned_broken_budgets_adopt_themselves` pins the
opted-in set and names every exclusion, so a row cannot gain the flag without the
suite that pins it being consulted. `auto_adopt` defaults to False, so a new row is
report-only until someone states otherwise.

Two further properties make the rewrite safe on the rows that remain, without the
per-key provenance the config layer still lacks:

- **One-shot.** `auto_adoptable()` excludes any key already in the sidecar's
  `adopted` map, so a key is adopted at most once per install and a value the
  operator sets back afterwards is theirs forever. Without that record the loader
  would re-remove a restored value on every load -- the one behaviour worse than
  saying nothing.
- **Marker first, chosen for its worst case.** `record_adoptions` writes the ledger
  entry BEFORE the removal, inside the config write lock, and a failing record aborts
  the whole migration write. `config.json` and the sidecar are two files with no
  shared transaction, so exactly one of two windows exists and the ordering decides
  which one:

  | Ordering | Window | Consequence |
  |---|---|---|
  | marker first (this) | durable marker, failed removal | the operator KEEPS their value and the adoption is not retried. A **missed improvement**, recoverable with `kirocrew config defaults --adopt` and still named by the startup line. |
  | removal first | landed removal, lost marker | nothing suppresses a later adoption, so a value the operator deliberately RESTORES is deleted a second time. A **destroyed choice**, unrecoverable. |

  No retry, rollback, compensating write or two-phase pending/committed scheme removes
  the window -- each only moves it onto another write that can fail the same way, and
  a rollback that fails recreates the hazard it exists to prevent. So the marker goes
  first and the failure lands on the recoverable side.
  `test_a_failed_write_keeps_the_value_and_does_not_re_adopt_later` pins that path
  end to end, including that a later load does not take the value on a retry, and
  `test_the_unapplied_adoption_is_still_reported_so_it_is_recoverable` pins that the
  marker suppresses the retry but not the report.
- **An adoption that did not reach disk drops the validated-data cache.** Only a load
  that READS the base document can decide an adoption (`adoptable` is empty on a cache
  hit, by design), so a read-and-skip that left its document cached would have every
  later load serve the stale value and never retry. Three paths skip the write -- a
  contended lock, the degraded-sections branch, an exception caught by the
  best-effort handler -- so `_load_resolved` tracks `adoption_landed` separately from
  `persisted` (which starts True so the `connections_ui` marker still lands on a load
  that needed no migration) and invalidates in a `finally` all three share. Both
  variables are bound before the `try`, or an early exception would turn a logged
  write-back failure into a `NameError` out of `load()`.
- **An unreadable ledger adopts nothing.** `_read_ack_document_status` returns
  `(document, readable)`, and `auto_adoptable` returns `[]` when a sidecar exists but
  cannot be parsed: reading it as empty would re-arm the one-shot over a value the
  operator restored. The ACK half stays fail-soft, because a missed ack costs one
  report line rather than a deleted setting.

`record_adoptions` takes the sidecar lock **single-shot** (`wait_for_lock=False`),
because the config load path runs on the asyncio event-loop thread in places and a
blocking acquire there stalls the gateway for as long as another writer holds it. A
contended acquire raises `BlockingIOError`, which the migration treats as "defer to
the next load" -- the same deferral `_persist_config_migration` already takes on a
contended config lock. A CLI caller keeps the wait: no loop to stall, no later retry.

`--keep` still wins: an acknowledged value is not drift, so affirming a key before
it is adopted keeps it, which is the answer for an operator who did choose 1800.

Adoption is an **un-materialization**, not a write of the new number:
`drop_drifted_keys` removes the stored key, so the field resolves through
`data.get(key, DEFAULT)`. That holds only until the next FULL rewrite of
`config.json` -- any settings save re-materializes the current number, as
`drop_drifted_keys`' own docstring says -- so a later default move on the same key
still needs its own registry row and does not ride along.

It is applied in memory as well, because the gateway reads these budgets once at
startup -- a disk-only fix would leave the run that performed it still holding the
old value, which is exactly the "upgraded and nothing changed" complaint. Two guards
on that half: `_adopt_in_memory` reads the field's OWN dataclass default rather than
the row's `new_default` (on a key whose default moved twice, the matching row's
`new_default` is an intermediate value), and it replaces the value only when the
parsed field still EQUALS `old_default`, so a value the loader clamped or coerced
keeps the loader's correction. A key the `config.local.json` overlay supplies is
cleared on disk but left alone in memory: the overlay is the operator's live choice.

After the config write succeeds, the loader warns at the default log level for each
adopted key, naming the removed value and the `kirocrew config set` command that
restores it. A deferred or failed write emits no adoption notice. The warning
describes the stored value without claiming to know whether the operator chose it.

`stt.provider` is deliberately absent from `SUPERSEDED_DEFAULTS` even though its
default moved to `local`: `_validated_stt_provider` coerces a retired value at
parse time, so the stored value never wins and there is no *default* for an
operator to adopt. It is instead a **coerced value**, tracked separately in
`COERCED_VALUES` — see below.

Both sides of an entry are **history**, so both are literals: a later change to
the same key APPENDS a new entry rather than editing an existing one, which keeps
the older row a true record of the change it describes. What must stay current is
the END of each key's chain --
`test_every_registered_key_ends_at_the_live_default` asserts the newest entry per
key names the default the loader actually applies, so moving a default without
appending a row fails rather than leaving the report telling operators to adopt a
value that no longer exists.

Two surfaces render it. Neither writes config; the load path's adoption above is
the only thing that does, and a key it adopts is excluded from the warning rather
than pointing the operator at a command for something already fixed:

- The load path emits **one** warning naming every drifted key plus the command to
  resolve it, evaluated on the **stored base document before the
  `config.local.json` merge** -- an overlay value is the operator's live choice and
  says nothing about what the base materialized, so a base drift is still reported
  when an overlay masks it, and an overlay-only value is not reported at all. One
  line rather than one per key: the registry is append-only, so a per-key line
  grows without bound on exactly the long-lived installs with the most real drift,
  and it lands on every short-lived `kirocrew` invocation, where the
  once-per-process guard buys nothing because there the process IS the invocation.
  The per-key text is still emitted at debug, so `-vv` keeps it in the log.
- `kirocrew doctor` prints a `Stored Defaults` section reading `config.json`
  directly. Drift is informational and does NOT become an issue; an unreadable or
  malformed config does.

## Acknowledging a superseded default

Value equality alone cannot falsify a report, so before #7559 an operator who
deliberately chose a value equal to a superseded default was told about it on every
load forever, with no way to answer -- and that unanswerable line competed for
attention with the genuine drift on the same install.

`kirocrew config defaults` is the surface that resolves the ambiguity the load path
must not resolve for anyone:

- no flag lists each drifted key with its stored value, the current default, and
  the release that changed it, marking anything already affirmed;
- `--adopt [KEY...]` REMOVES the stored keys, so `data.get(key, DEFAULT)` resolves
  the current default from the next load and the next full rewrite materializes it.
  Rewriting is safe here where it is not on the load path because the operator
  asked by name, and only a key whose stored value IS the superseded default is
  ever removed. Detection runs again inside the write lock, so a value changed
  since it was listed is left alone;
- `--keep [KEY...]` records the stored values as intentional, which suppresses the
  load-path line for exactly those values.

An acknowledgment records `<dotted key> -> the acked VALUE`, not the key alone, so
it covers the choice rather than the key: change the value later and the report
returns. Acks live in `~/.kiro/crew/superseded_acked.json` (`{"acked": {...}}`),
**not** in `config.json` -- a `to_dict()` rewrite carries only schema fields, so
the same materialization behaviour this whole mechanism reports on would silently
drop an ack stored in the config document. Three properties of that file matter:

- **Reads cannot block indefinitely.** The read runs on the config-load path, which
  is an event-loop path, and the file sits at a path the agent can name -- where
  `open()` on a FIFO waits for a writer forever and would wedge the gateway rather
  than merely delay it. `_read_ack_document` therefore `lstat`s and refuses anything
  that is not a REGULAR file (links included) or is over `ACK_MAX_BYTES` (64 KiB),
  opens with `O_NONBLOCK | O_NOFOLLOW` where the platform has them so a leaf swapped
  after the `lstat` fails instead of waiting, re-checks the OPENED object with
  `fstat`, then finishes with one capped `os.read`.
- **Every refusal fails soft.** Missing, non-regular, oversized, unreadable,
  malformed, not an object, a non-string key: an ack suppresses one line and changes
  no runtime behaviour, so the worst consequence of ignoring a broken file is being
  told again. That soft read is also why the file carries no schema version -- any
  shape it cannot understand is already handled, so the field would have no reader.
- **Writes never RESOLVE the leaf.** The config writers deliberately FOLLOW a link,
  because symlinking `config.json` into a dotfiles repo is a supported setup; here
  that would let a link planted at this path redirect the write onto an arbitrary
  file. `_update_acked` refuses a link it can see AND writes through `atomic_write`,
  which renames a fresh temp file OVER the leaf -- so a link swapped in after the
  check is replaced rather than followed. The check reports the condition; the rename
  is what makes it unexploitable.
- **Every mutation is a locked read-modify-write.** `_update_acked` holds the ack
  file's own lock across read, merge and write, so two concurrent `--keep` calls
  cannot both read the same map and have the second replacement drop the first
  operator's acknowledgment.
- **`record_acks` re-reads the config under its lock**, rather than trusting the
  caller's snapshot, and re-checks that each key is still drifted. A value changed
  between the listing and the call would otherwise be acknowledged at its superseded
  snapshot, which then suppresses the report for a value the operator never affirmed.
  The ack write happens inside that same config lock hold; lock order is
  config-then-ack at the only site that nests them.

`--adopt` also drops the ack for a key it removed, since the acked value is no
longer stored and keeping it would silence a genuinely deliberate choice made
later. When `config.local.json` also carries an adopted key the report says the
overlay still overrides it, because the EFFECTIVE value did not change. Every
filesystem refusal on these paths surfaces as a controlled non-zero CLI error,
never a traceback.

`doctor` LISTS an acknowledged entry rather than hiding it: an ack answers the
unsolicited load-path line, while `doctor` answers "what does this install still
hold?", and hiding an affirmed value would make that answer wrong.

## Coerced values (removable, never affirmable)

`COERCED_VALUES` in the same module tracks a second, distinct kind: a stored value
the loader **replaces** at parse time rather than merely overriding. The difference
decides what an operator may do about it. A superseded default still wins, so it
may be a deliberate choice and must not be rewritten. A coerced value cannot win,
so there is nothing to preserve — which makes removing it unambiguously safe and
makes affirming it meaningless, and `--keep` refuses it by name rather than
promising a setting that never takes effect. Left in place it is inert bytes that
cost a warning on every load, forever, because a load never writes.

One entry today: `stt.provider`, whose retired and unknown values degrade to
`local`. The `is_coerced` predicate rides on the ENTRY, not in the detector's loop,
so appending a retirement is genuinely sufficient — a detector switching on
`dotted_key` would leave an appended entry silently unreported, with no test red and
an operator stuck with a warning nothing can clear. That predicate delegates to
`sections.stt_provider_is_coerced()` rather than restating a provider list, so the
surface offering to remove a value cannot come to disagree with the loader about
which ones are dispatchable. The retirement notice in `_validated_stt_provider`
names the command, for the same reason the drift line does.

**Why nothing is corrected automatically.** At least one registered key also has a
documented escape hatch (`mcp_gateway.forward_declared_env`, whose stored `false`
is pinned as honoured by `test_a_real_false_still_turns_it_off`). On disk that
escape hatch and a stale materialized default are the same bytes, so a rewrite
cannot correct one without overriding the other. Telling them apart needs per-key
provenance -- a record of which keys the operator actually set -- which this layer
does not have.

## Config Overlay (config.local.json)

User overrides can be placed in `~/.kiro/crew/config.local.json`. This file is
deep-merged on top of `config.json` at load time and is never touched by
`kirocrew setup` or package upgrades.

Resolution order:
1. Load `config.json` (managed by KiroCrew, may be regenerated on upgrade)
2. Deep-merge `config.local.json` on top (user-owned, never touched by setup/migration)
3. Return merged result

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Save a setting to config.local.json (persists across upgrades):
kirocrew config set --local agent.yolo true

# Save to config.json (may be overwritten on upgrade):
kirocrew config set agent.yolo true
```

### `config_local_path() -> Path`
Returns `~/.kiro/crew/config.local.json` (or `$KIROCREW_HOME/config.local.json`).

### `_deep_merge(base: dict, overlay: dict) -> dict`
Recursively merges overlay into base. Dict values merge recursively; all other
types in overlay replace base values.

## Browser UI preferences (ui-prefs.json)

`~/.kiro/crew/ui-prefs.json` is a backup of the dashboard settings that live in
the renderer's `localStorage`, not in `config.json`. It exists because
`localStorage` is keyed by ORIGIN and, in the desktop app, stored inside
Electron's `userData` directory, so a moved dashboard port, a relocated
`userData` directory, a switch between the stable and nightly builds, or a
browser storage eviction wipes every setting the user chose — and reads to the
user as "the upgrade lost my settings".

Owned by `kiro_crew/ui_prefs.py`, served by `GET`/`PUT /api/ui-prefs`, and
consumed by `website/src/lib/uiPrefs.ts`. Deliberately NOT a section of
`config.json`:

- `KiroCrewConfig.save()` re-emits the whole dataclass, so a key the running
  build does not model is dropped on the next save. A bag of client-owned UI
  keys is exactly the shape that loses that fight.
- `config.json` is operator-facing; renderer layout keys do not belong in it.

Contract:

- Values are opaque UTF-8 strings (what `localStorage` holds). The server never
  parses them. The file is `{"prefs": {...}}` and nothing else: an earlier
  revision carried a `version` and an `updated_at` that no code read, and the
  loader is tolerant of any shape it does not recognize, so a future reshape
  needs no version field to be safe.
- `PUT` is a merge patch; a `null` value deletes its key. BOTH methods are
  owner-gated: the write so a viewer cannot overwrite the owner's settings, and
  the read because some values name real paths on the host (the file explorer's
  saved state, the cloud launch defaults). Gating the read costs nothing, since a
  non-owner can never have written a backup.
- Keys whose name looks like a credential (`token`, `secret`, `password`,
  `credential`, `api_key`) are refused on write and filtered on read, so the
  dashboard bearer token can never land here.
- Bounds: 200 keys, 128-char keys, 64 KiB per value, 512 KiB total. A patch that
  would breach them is rejected WHOLE; nothing partial is written. The client
  answers a rejection by retrying the patch one key at a time, so one unstorable
  value cannot discard the valid changes bundled with it.
- An unreadable or malformed file means "no backup", never an error: the client
  falls back to whatever `localStorage` holds.
- The client reads the backup when this profile has never successfully reached
  the host (`mc-ui-prefs-synced` absent) and only fills keys that are absent, so
  it can never clobber a value the running profile already has. Keyed on
  never-synced rather than no-settings-present so a boot whose fetch failed
  retries on the next one instead of forfeiting the restore. Otherwise the client
  is write-only: the backup is a backup, not a live cross-tab sync channel.
- When the restore actually wrote something the page RELOADS instead of
  rendering. Restoring before the first render is not sufficient on its own:
  static imports are evaluated before the entry module's first statement, so a
  store that reads its key at module scope (`hooks/useBottomTerminal.ts`) has
  already captured the pre-restore value and its first write would persist that
  stale copy back over the restored one. The reload is correct for every
  module-scope reader without a per-store re-init hook, costs one extra load on a
  fresh profile, and cannot loop because the synced marker is written first.
- Every key the host holds is baselined with whatever is in `localStorage` for it
  after the restore — including a local value that DIFFERS from the host's and
  was kept. The hydrating origin is by definition the one that has not been
  syncing, so uploading its value on first flush would overwrite the newer backup
  with a possibly months-stale one; baselined, it stays in use locally and is
  uploaded the moment the user changes it. A value the quota-safe writer had to
  drop is NOT baselined, or the first flush would read it as a deletion and null
  out a good host backup.
- A FAILED first restore writes `mc-ui-prefs-hydrate-pending` holding the list of
  durable keys the profile held AT THAT MOMENT. On the next successful restore a
  key in that list — and any change the user made to it since — is the user's,
  so local wins as usual; a key NOT in the list was written after the failure by
  a page that rendered without its settings (a login screen counts; mount-time
  hooks persist defaults), so for it the HOST wins — treating those defaults as
  the user's choice would upload them over the real backup. A repeat failure
  never widens the list. A never-failed first restore keeps the normal rule.
  Letting the host win for every key instead had the mirror-image defect: a
  returning user whose GET failed once and then changed a preference saw the
  stale host value overwrite the change. The marker is cleared only after the
  synced marker is written, so a crash between the two leaves the profile
  pending rather than synced-with-untrusted-locals.
- `mc-ui-prefs-synced` also holds the NAMES this profile last synced, which is
  how a deletion made before a reload is still reported as a `null` while a key
  this profile never synced is never nulled — that is what stops a second browser
  from deleting the first one's settings.
- Which keys are durable is the client's decision (`DURABLE_PREF_KEYS`).
  Session-scoped and derived state (height caches, panel tabs, drafts, touched
  files) is excluded, as are the settings `config.json` already owns (theme
  mode/colour, language, onboarding flags) and keys a migration deliberately
  deletes (`mc-zoom`, `mc-font-scale`), so no setting has two homes and nothing
  resurrects a key a migration removed. The per-surface prefs that used to
  silently reset across origins -- notification sound (`mc-notification-sound`),
  interface mode (`mc-ui`), reading width (`mc-reading-width`) -- are durable.
- GROWING the durable set is guarded by a reconcile pass (growth-gap issue
  9491). A warm profile never runs the cold restore, so a key added to the
  allowlist by an upgrade would otherwise be flushed at its local DEFAULT --
  often written by a hook on mount (`mc-ui` is the live example) -- overwriting
  the value another origin backed up. Before the first flush after an upgrade
  that added keys, the client reads the host copy once for the keys this
  profile has never synced: a key absent locally adopts the host value (with
  the same reload-if-restored rule as the cold path), a key present locally is
  baselined so the first flush does not upload it (it goes up when the user
  next changes it), and a key the host does not hold is seeded from local. The
  reconciled roster is recorded as a reserved entry inside `mc-ui-prefs-synced`
  -- deliberately not its own key, so a downgraded (pre-roster) build's next
  fingerprint rewrite sheds it and a re-upgrade reconciles again instead of
  trusting a stale roster -- making the pass one GET per allowlist growth, not
  per boot. A profile with no roster predates the mechanism and is baselined
  against the frozen pre-mechanism allowlist, so only genuinely new keys are
  reconciled: a key the profile merely never held is NOT bulk-imported from
  another origin. A failed reconcile suppresses
  the sync for the session -- flushing unreconciled keys is the exact clobber
  the pass exists to prevent -- and the next boot retries; the failed-restore
  marker applies as on the cold path, so a default written by a settings-less
  render between the failure and the retry loses to the host.
- Also excluded: any value that GATES A SAFETY CONFIRMATION. `mc-yolo-ack` is the
  instance — its presence makes the approval-mode picker skip the confirmation
  and enable full auto-approval — and the reason is that this file sits in the
  agent-writable data home, so a restorable ack is an ack an agent can forge for
  the user's next fresh origin. Convenience does not outrank a human gate.

## Unknown keys are preserved on round-trip

`save()` re-emits the whole dataclass, so anything the running build does not
model is absent from what it writes. Two capture fields stop that from erasing
the operator's settings on an upgrade:

- `_extra_sections` holds unknown TOP-LEVEL sections (an edition-contributed
  section written by a companion), classified against `_KNOWN_CONFIG_SECTIONS`.
- `_extra_keys` holds unknown keys INSIDE a modelled section, `{section: {key:
  value}}`, captured by `resolution.capture_extra_section_keys`. Without it, a
  build that renamed or removed `<section>.<key>` erased the value on the next
  `save()` of any kind (a log-level change, adding a workspace, editing an
  agent), with no backup on that path.

Both restore a key only when the emitted document LACKS it, so a captured copy
can never overwrite a live value or undo a deliberate deletion. `_extra_keys`
has two shapes: `{key: value}` for a dataclass-backed section, and
`{record_name: {key: value}}` for the maps of named records (`agents`,
`workspaces`, `memory_stores`), whose records are parsed field-by-field and
re-emitted with `asdict` and so lose unmodelled keys the same way a section
does. `hooks` needs neither: it is emitted raw and round-trips whole. A record
deleted in memory stays deleted — restore fills into existing records only.

Both capture from the BASE view of the document, not the merged one. When
`config.local.json` shadows an unknown key that `config.json` also holds, a
capture of the merged value made `save()` emit the overlay's leaf, which the
overlay subtraction then removed — permanently deleting the base file's own value,
so removing the overlay later revealed nothing. The loader therefore records the
base copy of every top-level section the overlay touches (`_shadowed_base_sections`)
at the last moment both documents exist, and captures against that. `save()`
then emits the base value, the subtraction leaves it (it differs from the overlay
leaf), and the overlay still wins on the next load. The base copy rides in the
validated-data cache's sidecar (`ConfigCache.get_with_sidecar`) so a cache hit — where
the overlay is no longer in scope — captures exactly as the disk read did.

A key is NOT captured when it is a field of the section's dataclass, starts with
an underscore, or appears in one of two explicit maps in `resolution.py`:

| map | why the key is excluded |
| --- | --- |
| `_SECTION_KEYS_EMITTED_ELSEWHERE` | `to_dict()` writes it from outside the section dataclass, either conditionally (`slack.channels`, `dm_activation`, `trusted_bot_ids` — absence is a deliberate deletion) or from the top-level object (`slack.observe_max_messages`, `observe_ttl_hours`). |
| `_SECTION_KEYS_DELIBERATELY_DROPPED` | The build chose not to round-trip it: RENAMED (`knowledge.auto_ingest_doc_links`, still read, canonical spelling written) or RETIRED (the removed local-STT install paths — re-persisting them would keep offering a setting with nothing behind it). |

A key the schema DOES model but validation rejected also stays dropped, because
re-emitting it would make the bad value permanent and re-warn on every load.

The failure direction is deliberate: forgetting an entry in
`_SECTION_KEYS_DELIBERATELY_DROPPED` preserves a key that could have been
dropped, which is cosmetic. The reverse is the data loss the mechanism exists to
prevent. `test_default_emitted_section_keys_are_all_recognized` guards
`_SECTION_KEYS_EMITTED_ELSEWHERE` against drift.

## APIs

### `KiroCrewConfig.load() -> KiroCrewConfig`
Loads config from disk. Merges `config.local.json` overlay if present.
Returns defaults if file is missing or invalid.

The installed package declares `jsonschema` as a core runtime dependency so
schema validation runs outside development environments too. The import guard
still lets an incomplete or manually damaged install load, but that fallback
must not be treated as the normal packaged behavior. Generated package metadata
is tested to ensure the validator is required without the `dev` extra.

**Hot-path cache.** `load()` is called per message / per request on several hot
paths. The expensive work — reading `config.json` (+ `config.local.json`),
`json.loads`, `_deep_merge`, and the full `jsonschema.validate` — is cached as
the validated, merged `data` dict, keyed on a fingerprint of both files
(`st_mtime_ns`, `st_size`, `st_mode`). On a cache hit, `load()` still builds
**fresh dataclasses from a deep copy**, so the many callers that mutate the
returned config in place (settings handlers, the write-back migration) never
corrupt the shared cache. The cache is mtime-keyed (not a blind TTL), so a
runtime edit is reflected on the next `load()`; `save()` also invalidates it
eagerly via `_invalidate_config_cache()`. The defaults-only path (neither file
present) is not cached.

### `KiroCrewConfig._resolve_agent_model() -> str`
Reads model from installed agent config (`~/.kiro/agents/kirocrew.json`),
falling back to the bundled `config_package_dir()/defaults.json` (i.e.
`src/kiro_crew/config/defaults.json`), then `DEFAULT_MODEL`.

### `KiroCrewConfig._resolve_named_agent_model(agent, agents_dir=None) -> str`
Returns a named agent's own kiro `model` field, or `""` if none. Used by
`SessionManager.get_or_create` so an explicit global `agent.model` ranks *below*
a per-agent model pin (per-agent pin > global default). Reads only the kiro
`model` slot. `agents_dir` is a dependency-injection seam for tests; defaults to
`kiro_agents_dir()`.

### `kiro_agents_dir() -> Path` (`config/paths.py`)
Leaf helper returning `~/.kiro/agents` — the **user-level** scope. Lives in the leaf
module so `loader.py` (and `_resolve_named_agent_model`'s `agents_dir` DI seam) can
locate installed agent JSONs without importing `kiro_crew.agent` — which imports
`config.loader` and would create an import cycle.

Deliberately **single-valued**: it is the WRITE target as well as a read scope
(`bridges._register_agents` and `agent.rebuild_agent_config` both write here), so it
is never widened into a search path.

A third writer is the side chat's derived read-only spec,
`dashboard/side_readonly_spec.publish_readonly_spec`: `<agent>--readonly.json` (or
`<agent>--readonly-<8 hex of the project path>.json` for a project-scope base, so two
checkouts declaring the same agent never contend for one file), the active agent's
spec with every backend-side grant emptied (`allowedTools: []`, no
`mcpServers.*.autoApprove`, no `toolsSettings.*.allowed*`/`trusted*`/`auto*`,
`includeMcpJson: false`, `autoAllowReadonly: false`, an empty KAS `permissions`) and
the lifecycle `hooks` removed, regenerated from the base spec on every side turn and
written atomically only when its content changed. It is a runtime resource, never
hand-edited (an edit is overwritten on the next turn), and it lives HERE because
kiro-cli discovers selectable agents from nowhere else: this directory and the
session's `<project>/.kiro/agents`, at process start (`acp/runtime.py`). The project
scope is the user's checkout, which Kiro Crew does not write into, so the user-level
registry is the only publishable location. The derived spec declares its own `name`
so no two files declare the base agent's name (`agent.agent_spec_path` refuses that
ambiguity), and its `description` starts with the owner marker
`Kiro Crew derived read-only spec`: the writer refuses — never overwrites — a file at
the derived path without that marker, and refuses to publish at all when another
spec (project scope, or a second user-scope file) declares the derived name, because
kiro-cli would load that one instead. See `side.md`.

### `project_agents_dir(project_dir)` / `project_kiro_dir(project_dir)` (`config/paths.py`)
The **project** scope, read-only: `<project>/.kiro/agents` (kiro-cli's own workspace
agents dir) and `<project>/.kiro` (which holds Kiro Crew's older
`*.agent-spec.json` convention). kiro-cli resolves `--agent` against
`$PWD/.kiro/agents` before the user-level dir with **no upward walk**, and Kiro Crew
spawns kiro-cli with the session's project directory as its cwd, so this is exactly
the directory the backend searches for that session.

Only `.kiro/agents/*.json` is **dispatchable**: kiro-cli does not read
`*.agent-spec.json`, so `agent_discovery.project_agent_files()` excludes it unless
the caller opts in with `include_legacy=True` (only the Slack handler does, for its
own pre-existing listing/resolution). Offering a legacy-only name on a dispatch
surface would have it accepted by the picker and by `spawn_run`, then fail at
`session/set_mode`.

### `resolve_agent_bindings(config, agent_name=None, project_dir=None) -> ResolvedBindings`
Resolves the workspace, memory store and **kiro agent** a session runs under.
Resolution order:

1. `agent_name` is a key in `config.agents` — use that alias's bindings.
2. `agent_name` is a **materialized kiro agent config** — a `*.json` under
   `~/.kiro/agents/` or, when `project_dir` is given, under
   `<project>/.kiro/agents/` — whose **declared `name`** matches (the filename stem
   only when the config declares no name) — take the *default* alias's
   workspace/memory bindings but dispatch **that agent itself**. `kiro-cli agent
   list` enumerates agents by declared name, so a namespaced filename stem such as
   `mochi--mochi` is NOT a name kiro-cli can resolve and must not be treated as
   dispatchable.
3. otherwise `config.default_agent`, then the first available alias, then bare
   defaults.

Rung 2 exists because an app's agents are materialized into `~/.kiro/agents/` by
`bridges._register_agents` under a namespaced FILENAME (`<app>--<agent>.json`)
while the config inside keeps the app's own bare `name`, and **nothing adds them
to `config.agents`** — that mapping is authored by setup / the user. Without it an
app-bound session fell through to `default_agent` and the DEFAULT agent answered
while the slot still advertised the requested name, with none of the app's MCP
tools. The rung is deliberately wider than app agents: **any** parseable config in
those directories dispatches with default bindings, because they *are* the
kiro-cli agent registry and narrowing to app-registered names would require
provenance they do not record.

`project_dir` must be the directory the session actually runs in (the same value
passed as the kiro-cli cwd).

**Neither scope touches the filesystem on the event loop.** The user-level scope is
served from the process-wide materialized snapshot (refreshed off-loop by the
writer); the project scope differs per session, so it is served by
`agent_discovery.project_agent_names()` — a per-project name set revalidated by a
stat-only signature, so a repeat scan costs two `scandir` walks rather than
re-reading every spec. `_project_declares_agent` splits on whether a loop is running:
off-loop it scans, on-loop it reads `cached_project_agent_names()`, which performs
**no syscalls at all** and reports "not declared" on a cold cache so the caller falls
back — exactly as the cold-snapshot user-level path does. Bounding the file *count*
is not the same guarantee as bounding *latency*: this runs on every turn of a
project-bound session, so a network or otherwise slow checkout would become a
recurring gateway stall the loop-stall watchdog blames on chat.

Async callers therefore **warm the cache before resolving**:
`agent_discovery.warm_project_agent_names()` runs the scan on
`executors.discovery_executor()` (the pool `/api/agents/installed` uses), after which
the on-loop read is a hit. `chat_runner._run_chat` and the side-turn handler both do
this.

`subagent._validate_agent` cannot warm — `spawn()` is synchronous and already on the
loop — so it reads the project scope from `cached_project_agent_names()` only. A
project agent is accepted once that project's cache is warm (any session that
resolved bindings for it has warmed it); a cold cache reports the name unknown, which
is fail-closed and matches that function's existing rule of refusing an unknown name
rather than silently running the default. Widening its pre-existing user-level scan to
a second directory instead would stall the gateway.

`slack/handler._resolve_agent_name` runs on the loop too, so it prefilters on the
**filename** and reads at most the one matching spec — resolving every spec's declared
name would stall Slack on a checkout with many agents.

**Only the warm is offloaded — never `resolve_agent_bindings` itself.** The resolver
can raise `StopIteration` (its defensive `next(iter(config.agents))` branch on a
malformed config), and `StopIteration` cannot be delivered through a `Future`:
asyncio rejects it, so an awaiting caller hangs instead of seeing the error, and the
`except Exception` that callers rely on never runs. Keeping resolution synchronous
preserves its exception contract for every call site.

`ResolvedBindings` additionally reports `requested_resolved` (whether the
requested name was honored — False means the default answered) and
`resolved_alias` (the alias key whose bindings were used). Callers that store a
name must store `resolved_alias`, never `kiro_agent`: the stored value is
re-resolved later with aliases matched FIRST, so a physical agent name that also
happens to be an alias key would dispatch that alias's target instead.

#### App-slot cold-snapshot self-heal & fail-loud (`dashboard/chat_runner._run_chat`)
The one-turn cold fallback above is acceptable for an ordinary session (the next
turn self-heals), but it is **not** acceptable for an **app-owned** slot
(`slot._app` truthy — an App-Kit slot bound to an app's own kiro agent, e.g.
`my-app-agent`). An app agent is never in `config.agents` and is resolvable
*only* through the materialized snapshot, so a cold on-loop read makes
`resolve_agent_bindings` fall back to the default agent with
`requested_resolved=False`. The result is silent: the slot still advertises the
requested name while the generic default agent answers **with none of the app's
MCP tools and no error**, leaving the app unusable until a gateway restart happens
to re-warm the snapshot. `_run_chat` therefore guards the resolve, strictly behind
`slot._app and not bindings.requested_resolved` (zero extra work / I/O on the
common hot path — no `_app`, or already resolved):

1. **Self-heal (two escalating steps).** First, **rescan** the snapshot **off the
   loop** with the same pattern `server.py` uses at boot —
   `await loop.run_in_executor(subprocess_executor(), refresh_materialized_agents)`
   (`refresh_materialized_agents` never raises, so awaiting it via the executor is
   safe) — then **re-resolve once**. This recovers an app slot whose spec is on
   disk but whose snapshot was simply not yet warmed on this loop. If the
   re-resolve *still* misses, the spec was never materialized even though the
   source is intact, so **re-register this app's resources from source** —
   `await loop.run_in_executor(subprocess_executor(), register_app, slot._app)`
   (`register_app`, `apps/bridges.py`, registers the app's MCP servers BEFORE its
   agents and publishes the snapshot synchronously; imported via a **local** import
   inside the function to avoid the top-level `apps`↔`dashboard` cycle, mirroring
   `server.py`'s local import of `reconcile_enabled_app_resources`. `register_app`
   is used rather than the narrower `refresh_app_agents` because a never-materialized
   app also has unregistered MCP servers, and re-materializing only the agent would
   inline an empty server map — recreating an agent whose own `@<app>:<server>` tool
   refs dangle, i.e. it dispatches but its tools never mount. `register_app` already
   honors the execution-admission gate, and the recovery call is additionally gated
   on `is_app_enabled(slot._app)` held under `app_lifecycle_lock(slot._app)`, so a
   concurrent disable/uninstall cannot race recovery into reactivating a
   deregistered agent — a disabled app simply falls through to the fail-loud) —
   then **re-resolve again** and use the fresh bindings. A recovery-step failure
   only logs a warning; it costs nothing beyond the fail-loud below.
2. **Fail-loud.** If the slot is app-owned and *still* unresolved after the
   from-source re-registration, `_run_chat` does **not** run the default agent. It
   raises `_AppAgentNotLoaded` (naming `slot.agent`, e.g. *"The app agent
   'my-app-agent' isn't loaded yet — try again in a moment, or restart the
   gateway"*) which a dedicated `except` arm beside the terminal turn-error
   handlers surfaces as a normal `error` card (no `record_failure` — nothing ran).
   The raise happens *before* `get_or_create`, while no session lock is held, so
   the standard `finally` teardown runs without ever creating a session or
   dispatching an agent.

The eager-spawn pre-warm path mirrors the **self-heal** step (rescan →
re-register-from-source) only (so the speculative session bakes in the app's own
agent rather than the default, which a first real turn would otherwise have to
discard); the **fail-loud** lives on the real turn alone, since the eager path is
best-effort and tears itself down on any miss.

`register_app` (`apps/bridges.py`) backs the from-source recovery with a **visible
error**: when a manifest declares agents but `_register_agents` materializes none
(source missing or unreadable) it appends a `"registered 0 of N declared
agent(s)"` entry to `result.errors` — which `reconcile_enabled_app_resources`
counts and logs — instead of returning a silent 0-agent success; a partial
registration (some but not all) logs a warning.

### Materialized-agent snapshot (`config/loader.py`)
Rung 2's membership test is a process-global `frozenset` — a pure in-memory lookup
with **no filesystem I/O, not even a stat**. It is reached on every turn of an
app-bound session from the gateway event loop (`_run_chat` →
`resolve_agent_bindings`), where a directory scan would stall chat, WebSocket and
heartbeat processing (`no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`).

The snapshot is only ever rebuilt off-loop:

- `refresh_materialized_agents()` — full rescan; **must** run off-loop. Reads each
  config through `hooks.safe_read_file`, so a symlink planted in that
  user-writable directory cannot make a boot refresh read a protected file;
  refused paths are skipped. A stem is trusted only after the file parses as a
  JSON object.
- `schedule_materialized_agents_refresh()` — safe from anywhere: offloads to the
  default executor when a loop is running, refreshes inline when not.
- `publish_materialized_agents(names)` — pure set union, no I/O, so it is safe on
  the loop. `_register_agents` publishes what it just wrote **before** scheduling
  the rescan, so a slot created before the rescan lands still resolves.
- `_register_agents` / `_deregister_agents` schedule a rescan around their writes
  (unconditionally on the register side: a call that writes nothing may follow a
  prune, and only a rescan drops a name that is gone from disk).

Two guards keep concurrent updates coherent, each with a test that fails when it
is disabled: a **generation counter** bumped by every publish (a scan that globbed
before a write unions rather than replacing, so it cannot erase a just-published
name), and a **monotonic ticket** taken when a refresh starts (a completed scan is
discarded if a refresh that started later already applied, so an older view
finishing second cannot resurrect a deleted agent). A lookup with no snapshot yet
builds one lazily **only** in a synchronous context; on a running loop it falls
back for that turn rather than block.

### Effective-agent report (`resolve_effective_agent`)
`resolve_agent_bindings` stores the REQUESTED agent verbatim and only logs when
nothing dispatches it, because rewriting the stored name was destructive: the
resolution behind the rewrite can be momentarily stale while the overwrite is
permanent. `resolve_effective_agent(agent_name, project_dir)` is the
non-destructive other half — it names the agent that will actually answer, and
`""` for "nothing to report".

Two properties, both pinned by tests:

- **No filesystem I/O**, for the same reason rung 2 has none: it is called from
  `_ChatSlot.to_dict()` for every slots frame on the event loop. It reads only the
  materialized snapshot, the alias snapshot published by `KiroCrewConfig.load()`
  (`publish_agent_alias_snapshot`), and `cached_project_agent_names` — never a
  scan, stat or config re-read.
- **Fails closed to `""`.** A cold alias snapshot, a cold materialized snapshot
  and a cold project cache all report no divergence. A false "your agent was
  substituted" marker sends the user chasing a substitution that never happened,
  so silence during a boot window is the correct answer, not a guess.

Consumers: the sidebar's session-row marker, and `mochi`'s `ensureSlot`, which
refuses to send into a slot whose effective agent is someone else.

Known follow-up (#1429): the snapshot makes this module a second home for agent
discovery beside `apps/registry`.

### `KiroCrewConfig.create_provider_factory() -> Callable`
Returns a factory for LLMProvider instances. Resolves `"auto"` model
before creating the provider.

### `KiroCrewConfig.to_dict() -> dict`
Serializes config to the JSON structure used by `config.json`. Uses `_configured_port`
(the file value) instead of `dashboard_port` (which may be overridden by `KIROCREW_PORT`
env var) to avoid clobbering the saved port on write-back.

### `KiroCrewConfig.save() -> None`
Writes current config to `~/.kiro/crew/config.json` via `to_dict()`, through
`write_config_atomically()` (see below). Invalidates the `load()` validated-data
cache so the next load reflects the write immediately.

### Partial config updates: `read_config_for_update()` / `write_config_atomically()`

Many callers do not hold a whole `KiroCrewConfig` — they flip one toggle
(`auto_update`), persist one channel, or seed one default. That shape is a
**read the whole file → mutate one key → write it all back** cycle, and both
halves of it are data-loss-prone. These two helpers are the required primitives
for it; do not hand-roll the cycle.

**`read_config_for_update(path=None) -> dict` fails CLOSED.** The natural
`try: json.loads(...) except Exception: data = {}` is a bug in this shape,
because the `{}` fallback is indistinguishable from "the user has no settings" —
so the write-back replaces a fully populated config with a single-key one, every
setting the user ever chose is gone, and the endpoint still reports success. So:
an **absent** file returns `{}` (a genuine empty starting point), while an
unreadable or non-JSON-object file raises **`ConfigReadError`**. Callers must let
that abort the update; leaving the existing file untouched always beats
overwriting it with defaults. `ConfigReadError` deliberately does **not** inherit
from `OSError`/`ValueError`, so a pre-existing broad `except OSError` around the
write cannot swallow it and resume the clobbering path.

The read fails for mundane reasons, most commonly a **torn read**: a
truncate-then-write config writer leaves a window in which a concurrent reader
observes a half-written file. The window is small, which is exactly what made the
resulting loss so hard to reproduce — it presented as "all my settings reset
themselves".

**`write_config_atomically(path, data, *, fsync=False)` is atomic AND
mode-preserving.** Atomic (tmp+rename) so no reader ever sees a partial file —
this is what closes the torn-read window for everyone else. Mode-preserving
because tmp+rename creates a NEW inode, so the umask default (typically `0644`)
would silently replace an operator's tightened `0600`; `config.json` can hold
inline credentials, so a settings write must never widen who can read it. An
existing file's mode carries over and a newly created one is owner-only. On
Windows it also applies a real owner-only DACL via
`platform_compat.restrict_to_owner` (`restrict_on_error="warn"`, so a DACL that
cannot be applied warns rather than making the config unwritable).

That is a reversal of an earlier ruling recorded here, and the reason it changed
is worth keeping: the lockdown used to shell out to `icacls`, a blocking
subprocess this function could not afford because it runs inside async request
handlers and `save()` (`no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`). It is now applied
in-process through `advapi32` (measured 0.24 ms against 313 ms for the
subprocess), so the cost that forced the omission is gone and `config.json` --
which can hold inline provider tokens -- is no longer left under whatever DACL it
inherits from its parent. Follow-up work that touches the other owner-only call
sites should treat this as settled rather than re-deriving the old constraint.

**Mode preservation is POSIX-only.** `atomic_write`'s `mode` routes through
`fchmod_safe`, a documented no-op on Windows, where access is carried by the DACL
instead. The two guarantees therefore do not collide -- they apply on different
platforms -- which is why the writer branches on `IS_POSIX` rather than passing
both to `atomic_write`, which refuses `restrict_to_owner=True` alongside a wider
explicit `mode`. The three mode/symlink tests in
`test_config_rmw_preserves_settings.py` are `skipif(not IS_POSIX)` for this reason;
its Windows counterpart asserts the DACL by reading the descriptor back, and the
data-loss and AST-guard tests are platform-independent and run everywhere.

**Symlinks are followed, not replaced.** `os.replace` renames over the link
itself, so a symlinked `config.json` would become a regular file and its target
would go stale — the `write_text` this replaced followed the link. The target is
resolved before the stat and the write, so symlinking the config into a dotfiles
repo keeps working.

**Atomicity is not serialization.** `write_config_atomically()` guarantees a
reader never sees a partial file; it does NOT serialize a read-modify-write
against another process. Two writers that interleave (the CLI and the gateway,
say) are still last-writer-wins per key, since each read its own snapshot before
mutating. In-process dashboard handlers additionally take `_get_config_lock()`,
which serializes them against each other but not against a separate process.

One deliberate exception: the interactive `kirocrew config set --local` path
overwrites a corrupt `config.local.json` rather than failing closed — the user
typed an explicit command and sees the result on stdout. Pinned by
`test_config_overlay.py::TestCliConfigSetLocal`.

### `config_dir() -> Path`
Returns `~/.kiro/crew/` (nested under kiro-cli's `~/.kiro/` base). Overridden by
`KIROCREW_HOME` env var (refuses system directories like `/`, `/usr`, `/System`,
`/etc`). On the default (non-override) path, a pre-move `~/.kirocrew` is migrated
once into `~/.kiro/crew` — see "Data Home Location & Migration" above.

### `config_path() -> Path`
Returns `~/.kiro/crew/config.json` (or `$KIROCREW_HOME/config.json` if overridden).

### Agent Bookkeeping Sidecar (`agent_model_state.json`)

KiroCrew tracks two pieces of per-agent state that are **not** part of the
kiro-cli agent schema: `model_managed` (whether an agent's `model` tracks the
shipped default or is a frozen user pick) and `cc_model` (a per-agent Claude
Code model). kiro-cli validates `~/.kiro/agents/*.json` with serde
`deny_unknown_fields` and rejects the *entire* spec on any unknown key, then
silently falls back to the default agent (`--agent <name>` resolves to default
with only a stderr "no agent with name X found" line). To keep every spec
schema-valid, this state lives in a KiroCrew-owned sidecar
`~/.kiro/crew/agent_model_state.json` (honoring `KIROCREW_HOME`), keyed by agent
name:

```json
{
  "kirocrew":           {"model_managed": true},
  "kirocrew-heartbeat": {"cc_model": "claude-sonnet-4.6"}
}
```

- Read/written via `kiro_crew/agent_state.py` (atomic, lock-guarded near-leaf
  module: stdlib + `config.paths` + `atomic_write` only).
- `build_agent_config()` is pure (writes no spec key); `rebuild_agent_config()`
  seeds managed-state on a fresh/clean install (never clobbering a frozen pick).
- `_refresh_dynamic_fields()` sources managed-state from the sidecar and strips
  any stray `model_managed`/`cc_model` from the spec (steady-state self-heal).
  A **managed** spec's `model` is set on every refresh to the shipped default,
  or to the `"auto"` sentinel when the shipped template pins none — never left
  as-is. That is what makes the global `agent.model` reversible: the global is
  propagated into the spec when it is a concrete pick, and because a spec pin
  outranks the global in `resolve_effective_model`, returning the global to
  `"auto"` must take the pin back off or `"auto"` is unreachable from the
  configuration surface. Ownership decides who may clear: `model_managed=false`
  (an explicit user pick) and an **absent** sidecar entry (legacy status, owner
  unknown) both keep their pin untouched.
- `migrate_agent_specs()` runs at startup (top of `rebuild_agent_config`): lifts
  the keys out of every `~/.kiro/agents/*.json` into the sidecar and removes
  them (idempotent), fixing installs polluted by older builds.
- The dashboard model PATCH writes the sidecar, never the spec; agent DELETE
  prunes the sidecar entry.
- `agent_state.lift_and_strip_bookkeeping()` is the single shared
  implementation of the lift/strip/no-clobber rule above (with a type guard —
  a non-`bool` `model_managed` or non-`str` `cc_model` is stripped but never
  lifted, since coercing it could silently flip its meaning). All four spec
  writers call it — the dashboard's whole-config `PUT /api/agent/config`
  handler, the per-agent `PATCH /api/agent/<name>` handler,
  `migrate_agent_specs()`, and `_refresh_dynamic_fields()` — so none of them
  can drift from the other three.

Note: KiroCrew is KiroACP (kiro-cli) only — the deleted `claude_code` provider
was the sole reader of spec `cc_model`, so `cc_model` is now dead config. The
lite/heartbeat installers still write it to the sidecar (harmless bookkeeping)
purely to keep the kiro spec schema-clean; nothing in the fork resolves it.

**Invariant:** `~/.kiro/agents/*.json` must contain only kiro-cli schema keys at
all times — after install, refresh, and any dashboard edit — or kiro-cli drops
the agent and silently falls back to default.

## Live config: one watcher, one applier registry

`config/live.py` is the single mechanism by which a write to `config.json`
reaches the objects that already copied a value out of it. Before it, a
long-lived object built at boot (a session manager's idle timeout, a channel
transport's allow-list, a workflow ceiling) kept its boot copy forever unless the
particular writer happened to know that copy existed — so `kirocrew config set`,
a dashboard save and an `$EDITOR` edit each hot-applied a *different* subset of
fields, and every other field was silently inert until the next restart.

Three parts, each deliberately singular:

**One poll.** `ConfigWatch` runs one background task that compares
`loader._config_fingerprint()` (mtime_ns + size + mode of `config.json` and
`config.local.json`) every `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL_SECS` (2s, floored at 0.05).
The two `stat` calls run in `asyncio.to_thread`, never on the loop. Nothing else
in the gateway polls `config.json`.

**One kick.** An in-process writer does not wait for the tick: it calls
`live.notify_config_written()`, which sets a force flag and wakes the poll
through `call_soon_threadsafe`. The force flag matters independently of the
wake — the fingerprint is mtime-based, and a coarse filesystem clock can make a
write invisible to it, so a kicked cycle reloads whether or not the fingerprint
moved. Safe from any thread and a no-op in a process with no watcher (the CLI).

**One reload, one diff, one dispatch.** A cycle performs exactly one
`KiroCrewConfig.load()` off the loop, so the `publish_*` snapshots the loader
maintains ride along rather than needing a second reader. Old and new documents
are flattened to dotted leaf paths (`flatten_config`; lists and empty dicts are
leaves, because every list-typed field is a whole value whose consumers rebuild
from the full list) and diffed (`diff_config_docs`). The new config is adopted
*before* dispatch so an applier reading `live.snapshot()` sees it, and the
PRE-load fingerprint is recorded so a write landing mid-read leaves it unequal to
the file and the next tick reloads. Cycles are serialized by a lock, so the diff
is always old-vs-newer and an applier never sees an out-of-order pair.

### The applier registry

`live.subscribe(*prefixes, callback=..., name=...)` is the only sanctioned place
for work a gateway does in response to a config write. Rules the registry keeps:

- **Prefix-scoped.** An applier fires only when a changed path is one of its
  prefixes or lies under one (whole dotted segments: `agents` is not under
  `agent`). No prefixes means every reload — a catch-all, and a review smell.
- **Registration order is dispatch order**, so an applier may depend on one
  registered before it (a rebuild before the consumer that reads it).
- **Sync or async**, awaited if awaitable.
- **A raising applier cannot starve the rest, and is not left stale.** Each call
  is guarded; the failure is logged at ERROR with the applier's NAME and dispatch
  continues. The watcher remembers the changed paths that applier missed and
  re-dispatches exactly those to it on the next tick (a synthesized change whose
  `old` and `new` are the current snapshot), quietly at DEBUG until it succeeds;
  a real change arriving first carries the missed paths in the same dispatch. So
  a transient failure delays adoption by one poll interval instead of until the
  same fields happen to change again.
- **An awaitable applier that hangs cannot stall the rest indefinitely either.**
  Appliers dispatch sequentially under one cycle lock, so a call that never
  returns would otherwise block every applier after it and any concurrent
  `refresh_now()` caller. `_apply_one` wraps an awaited result in
  `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=APPLIER_TIMEOUT_SECS)` (10s); a timeout is
  logged and staled exactly like a raised exception. This bounds an async
  applier that hangs on an internal `await` — it cannot bound a synchronous
  applier that blocks the loop outright, since nothing suspends until the
  result is awaitable in the first place. Write appliers non-blocking.
- **A bound method is held weakly** (`weakref.WeakMethod`), so a manager
  discarded by a test or a provider reload falls out of the registry on its own.
  A free function or lambda is held strongly — it has no owner to outlive.
- **Values are never logged, only changed paths**: `to_dict()` carries channel
  tokens and the diff sees them.
- **`cancel()` is the removal verb** (there is no `close()`), and is idempotent.

### The three one-line registrations

`subscribe` is the primitive; almost no applier should be written against it
directly. Three shapes on top of it cover every value-adoption site and are what
a new setting registers with, in the owning object's constructor:

| Shape | When | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `live.watch_section(owner, "wecom", "messaging", target="transport")` | a subsystem owns one top-level section and exposes `reconfigure(section_cfg)` | fires under `wecom` (or `messaging`); resolves `owner.transport` at dispatch time and calls its `reconfigure(change.new.wecom)`; a `None` target (transport not connected yet) is a no-op; **fails closed** on a section the loader marked degraded (`fail_closed=True` by default and mandatory for anything carrying authorization), so an allow-list is never rebuilt from an unparseable document |
| `live.watch_object(owner, "memory", "skills.max_skills")` | an object's settings span sections or are normalized together, and it exposes `reconfigure(cfg)` | fires under any prefix and hands the whole `KiroCrewConfig` over |
| `live.bind("agent.max_channels", mgr.set_max_channels)` | one scalar with an existing setter | calls `setter(value at that path)` when that leaf changes |

All three hold the owner weakly (through the setter's `__self__` for `bind`),
so a discarded object drops out of the registry like a weakly held bound
method. What they remove is the per-site ceremony that used to be copied by
hand — the prefix gate, the `None`-transport guard and, above all, the
degraded-section refusal, which is an authorization safety check and must not
exist as nine hand-written copies. What stays on `subscribe` is orchestration
rather than value adoption: the in-process channel restart, the provider
switch, the SEL-audited approval widening, the Slack section's fan-out.

### The point-of-use read

`live.current(fallback, log_prefix=...)` is for a call site that reads a value
mid-turn rather than reacting to a change — every channel dispatcher's per-turn
threshold and DM-scope reads. It returns the watcher's `snapshot()` when armed,
else a disk `KiroCrewConfig.load()`, else *fallback* (with a warning naming
*log_prefix*) when even that raises. `snapshot()` alone is not enough for these
callers: a dispatcher can run before the watcher is primed (see boot ordering
below) or in a process with none at all, and `current` is the one place that
disk-load-then-fallback chain is written, rather than nine copies of it.

A load that raises keeps the previous snapshot, records `last_error`, dispatches
nothing, and retries on the next tick. A file that does not PARSE as a JSON
object right now (`_document_is_torn`, checked on the file itself because the
loader's degradation flag is sticky for the process) also keeps the previous
snapshot's VALUES — only the flag is taken from the new load, so the gates
that fail closed on `degraded_sections` still see it — and diffs empty, so no
applier and no `current()` reader ever sees the all-defaults document the
loader answers for an unparseable file (a forum activation of `always`, an
empty allow-list, for the length of the tear). Once the file parses again the
load is adopted as it is, still flagged, and a repair to new values diffs and
dispatches them. A load that *succeeds degraded* with the file parseable (a
section the loader itself discarded, named in `degraded_sections`) does
dispatch: the watcher does not refuse on the applier's behalf, because whether
a default is safe is a property of the consumer. A fail-closed applier — every
channel allow-list — reads `change.new.degraded_sections` and keeps its previous
authorization state; a plain one (a timeout, a log level) adopts the default,
which is the correct answer for it.

A fail-closed refusal is **deferred, never dropped**: the applier raises
`ConfigDeferred(paths)` and the watcher records those paths in the same stale
table an applier exception lands in (logged once at WARNING, then at DEBUG while
the applier keeps deferring). The same exception carries a second meaning for one
applier: the channel-restart applier raises it before the transports have
started, so a boot-window edit waits in the stale table and is applied by the
first tick after they are up — through `_apply_one`, with the degraded check,
rather than by a replay of the boot loop's own. The distinction matters because the watcher adopts the
degraded document as its snapshot — the refused section at DEFAULTS — so a
repair that writes back exactly those defaults diffs EMPTY. Before this a skip
was a silent success and nothing would ever re-run the applier: a revocation
written alongside a malformed field stayed unapplied for good. Now every clean
load re-runs the stale appliers against the current document even when it has
nothing to diff (`_retry_stale` on the empty-diff and unchanged-fingerprint
paths), so the roster catches up with the repair. `_section_applier`,
`_object_applier`, the `bind()` leaf applier (a discarded section holds a leaf's
DEFAULT, and a bound setter handed that default would reset a cap or a ceiling),
`_on_slack_config_change`, `_on_channel_config_change` and the session manager's
applier all raise it; the channel applier raises only the DEGRADED channels'
paths after scheduling the healthy channels' restarts, so the retry never
restarts a channel twice.

The refusal keys on the applier's OWN section being in `degraded_sections`, never
on the whole-config marker `*` alone. The loader keeps every degradation it has
observed for the life of the process (`resolution._OBSERVED_DEGRADED_SECTIONS`:
its gates must stay closed after a save has normalized the evidence away), so a
document loaded after a since-repaired tear still carries `*`; an applier that
refused on it would defer every tick until a restart while each save reported
applied — a revocation written after one transient typo would never land. It
does not need to: a document that is torn NOW never reaches an applier, because
the watcher keeps the previous snapshot while the file does not parse (above),
and the one way the two could disagree — a write landing between the loader's
read and the torn-file probe — is closed in `_cycle`: when the probe finds the
file whole but the load carries `*`, the fingerprint is re-read, and a read the
file moved under is treated as torn (previous snapshot kept, next tick reloads).
So on a dispatched change `*` is only the loader's memory of a repaired tear,
and the section flags — which the loader assigns only to the fail-closed
sections `dashboard`, `memory` and `publish` (validation removes a malformed
non-object anywhere else before the loader could flag it) — are the ones a tear
never produces and a save destroys the evidence of, hence the ones that stay
sticky and keep their appliers deferred until the restart main documents for a
malformed fail-closed section.

Where appliers live: an applier owned by a long-lived object registers in that
object's constructor (session manager, subagent manager, each channel
dispatcher; `WorkflowService` binds `agent.workflow_run_timeout_secs` to its
`set_timeout_secs` and `ChannelManager` binds `agent.max_channels` /
`agent.max_channel_agents` to its cap setters, both with `live.bind`). Only the
ones whose holder is `DashboardState`, or that must rebuild agent artifacts,
live in `server.py::_register_config_watch` — `agent.provider`,
`agent.role_models.background`, and `agent.log_level`
(→ `handlers/updates.py::apply_log_level_from_config`).
The provider applier only schedules the switch: `reload_provider_factory` clears
the session registry and then shuts the retired providers down one at a time,
which can outlast the applier bound, and a timed-out applier is retried on the
next tick — a retried switch would clear the sessions created with the new
provider in between. So the switch runs off the cycle as a task tracked in
`state._background_tasks` (the same shape as a channel reconnect), the applier
returns at once, and the switch runs exactly once per change. Because it runs
later, it installs the watcher's snapshot current at install time rather than
the document it was scheduled with -- a change that landed in between (a
`refresh_defaults` install) must not be reverted -- and falls back to the
scheduled document only when that snapshot is torn, since a torn `agent`
section holds defaults.
That function must be called before `runner.setup()` freezes the signal lists;
the watcher itself starts in `on_startup`, because it needs the running loop, and
stops in `on_cleanup`.

### `restart=True` is the single source of restart truth

`ConfigEntry.requires_restart` in `config/schema.py` is the ONE statement of
which fields a running gateway cannot adopt. It is emitted into the schema API as
`requiresRestart` only when true (absent means hot), and `requires_restart(path)`
resolves it through ancestors, so a marked container covers keys the schema never
enumerates (`mcp_gateway.stub_servers.<name>`, `agent.jail.<key>`).

Consequences, and they are the point:

- A request handler keeps **no list of boot-only keys**. The dashboard's PUT
  computes `restart_required` as
  `_changed_paths_need_restart(changed)` over the schema, and the old
  `_STARTUP_READ_AGENT_KEYS` ladder is gone.
- The hint is computed over paths whose value actually **moved**. The dashboard
  sends every setting on each save, so "was applied" is not "was changed" — an
  untouched `restart=True` field must not make a live edit claim a restart.
- Adding a hot-appliable field is a schema change plus an applier, never a
  handler edit. Marking a field `restart=True` is the admission that no applier
  exists for it.
- That admission is enforced, not conventional: `ConfigWatch.subscribe`,
  `watch_section`, `watch_object` and `bind` refuse (`ValueError`) a prefix at
  or under a `restart=True` path at registration time, so an applier for a
  boot-only field cannot be added without first dropping the mark — and the
  owner's own constructor tests trip it. A section-wide registration
  (`"whatsapp"`) stays allowed: its applier adopts the section's live fields
  and ignores the marked leaf. `agent.approval_mode` is marked for this reason:
  every channel dispatcher resolves it once at start, so no single consumer may
  take it live.
- **Review checklist for a new field.** An unmarked field is a UI-visible
  promise ("this applied live"), and nothing mechanical ties that promise to
  code. So a PR that adds a config field must name, in its description, one of:
  the applier that adopts it — normally one line, `live.watch_section` /
  `live.watch_object` / `live.bind` in the owner's constructor, or a new field
  read inside an existing `reconfigure` — the point-of-use read
  (`live.snapshot()` at the call site) that makes construction-time capture
  irrelevant, or the `restart=True` mark. A field with none of the three is the
  silently-inert bug this design exists to kill, now with the settings UI
  affirming that the value took effect.
- **A reload that can widen approvals is audited.** `HookManager` follows
  `hooks.*` live, and `config.json` is writable by an auto-approved agent shell,
  so its applier SEL-logs an `auto_approve_tools` / `auto_approve_sources` /
  `auto_approve_subagent_*` change (`hook_manager.reconfigure`,
  `auto_approve_changed`, counts and flag names only) the way the channel
  transports audit an allow-list reload. Governance still caps the resulting
  set; the audit closes the gap between "widened at a restart" and "widened in
  two seconds, mid-session, with no trace".

Currently marked: `agent.jail`, `agent.dangerously_skip_permissions`,
`agent.approval_mode`, `dashboard.url`, `dashboard.tailscale.*`,
`dashboard.restore_sessions`, `dashboard.restore_window_minutes`,
`dashboard.surface_channel_sessions`, `dashboard.cautious_boot`,
`dashboard.auto_open_browser`, `tunnel.*`, `instances.*`, `mcp_gateway.*`
(every field of the section), `memory.embed_model_id`, `memory.embed_model_path`,
`memory.embedding_dim`, `slack.command`, `whatsapp.db_path`, and
`messaging.dm_scope` — the last because it names the session-key namespace whose
per-conversation generation counters are seeded at boot, so a live flip could
resume a stale session persisted under the other namespace. The schema is the
source of truth for this list: `requires_restart()` over `SCHEMA_REGISTRY`
answers it, and this prose is a reader's convenience.

### Which write paths kick the watcher

Every door onto `config.json` ends at `notify_config_written()`, so the dashboard,
the CLI and an `$EDITOR` save all reach the hot-apply path identically. A writer
that forgets the kick is one setting that stays silently inert until the poll
happens to notice — which is the bug class this closes.

| Write path | Where |
|---|---|
| `update_config_locked` | `config/loader.py` — the required path for new mutations; skips the kick when the mutate returns `None` (no write) |
| `KiroCrewConfig.save()` | `config/loader.py` |
| `_persist_config_migration` | `config/loader.py` — a boot migration is a config write like any other |
| `refresh_config_meta_stamp` | `config/loader.py` — kicks only when the stamp actually moved (no rewrite, no mtime churn) |
| `_atomic_json_write` | `agent.py` — via `_notify_if_config_write`, and ONLY when the target resolves to `config_path()`; the per-channel savers and the STT PUT reach the file through here, bypassing the loader's writers |

A handler that must answer only after the new value is in force calls
`ConfigWatch.refresh_now()` (`handlers/core.py::_hot_apply_after_write`), which
forces one cycle and is a no-op before the watcher is started. The config PUT
and every per-channel saver (`handlers/messaging.py`, the WhatsApp saver in
`handlers/whatsapp_setup.py`) do, because their writes carry authorization: a
narrowed allow-list is applied to the running transport before the caller sees
"saved", never one poll interval after it. For a connection field the same
dispatch also drops the old client's mirror registration synchronously and
schedules its reconnect, so a request that follows the response (a WhatsApp QR
start, a mirror send) is never handed the client about to be closed.

**A two-file save runs under `live.hold()`.** A saver that writes `config.json`
and then `.env`, and rolls the config back when the credential write fails
(Teams, Webex, WeCom, Feishu), wraps the whole transaction — snapshot through
rollback and the `os.environ` sync — in `with live.hold():`. Without it the
config write's own kick (`_atomic_json_write` → `notify_config_written`) wakes
the watcher while the handler is still awaiting the `.env` write, and a widened
allow-list the committed state never granted is applied to the running transport
for the length of the failing write. Under a hold the cycle records that a
reload is owed and returns without loading; the release wakes it on the
committed (or restored) file. Savers that write `.env` first and `config.json`
second (Slack, Discord, Telegram) have no rollback window and need no hold.
Pinned per channel by the `*_config_handlers` tests
(`test_the_config_and_env_writes_run_under_the_live_config_hold`) and for the
watcher itself by `test_config_live.py`.

Tests: `test/test_config_live.py` (diff, registry, lifecycle, fingerprint,
dispatch order and scope, every write path, the schema/handler agreement, the
`server.py` appliers, and the owned-applier shapes `watch_section` /
`watch_object` / `bind`) and `test/test_channels_a_hot_reload.py` (every
channel's applier, its fail-closed degrade refusal and its point-of-use reads,
parametrized over the case table in `test/_hot_reload_helpers.py`;
`test_channels_b_hot_reload.py` and `test_channels_c_hot_reload.py` carry the
per-channel claims that are not shared).

### Crew member identity: the `agents` key is an id, `display_name` is the label

A crew member is a Kiro custom agent plus a Kiro Crew wrapper (the `agents` row and
`members/<id>/`). The row's KEY is the member's **id**: system-minted, immutable,
inside the member-id grammar (`member_identity.MEMBER_ID_RE`, pinned byte-equal to
`validation._AGENT_NAME_RE`, the grammar every keyed subsystem -- member dir, DM
binding, slot `agent`, cron `agent`, governance identity -- already enforces). What
a person reads and renames is `display_name` (free text, `""` = same as the id) plus
`role` (job title). `member_identity.py` is a leaf module (no `kiro_crew.config`
import) because the loader calls it during `load()`.

- **Create** (`POST /api/agents`): the typed name is only ever the display name; the
  id is minted from it inside the config lock (`mint_member_id`). For a name inside
  the grammar the id IS the name, and `display_name` is stored as `""`, so a plain
  create leaves the row byte-compatible with a pre-split one. A collision on the
  minted id is a 409 `agent_exists` whose message names the typed name AND the id it
  shortened to when they differ (the user never saw the id they collided on). A label
  or role longer than `DISPLAY_NAME_MAX_LEN` (80, whitespace-collapsed) is refused
  (`display_name_too_long` / `role_too_long`), never truncated: the credential check
  runs on the WHOLE submitted value, and a stored prefix of a value it would have
  refused is the exposure it exists to prevent (a label ending in a key, cut one byte
  short, carries nineteen twentieths of that key past a check keyed on the full
  pattern). On read, `normalize_display_name` turns an over-long hand-edited value
  into `""` (label = id) for the same reason. A
  credential-shaped label or role is refused
  (`credential_shaped_name` / `credential_shaped_role`), the same rule the roster mask
  applies on read.
- **Rename** (`PUT /api/agents/{id}` with `display_name`) mutates the label only.
  There is no key rewrite anywhere.
- **Read**: `GET /api/agents` rows carry `display_name` (resolved: the id when the
  row stores none) and `role` through `_roster_mask`; `GET /api/members` rows carry
  them through the roster's credential / exfiltration-URL redactors. Both fields are
  in `_AGENT_UNTRUSTED_TEXT_FIELDS`, which the dataclass-enumerating test pins.

**`MIGRATE_MEMBER_IDS` (write-back migration).** A row whose key is outside the
grammar -- the `case competition` incident: created, stored, and silently filtered
out of every roster because a key with a space cannot address anything -- is re-keyed
to a minted id with the typed string kept as `display_name`. Both halves call ONE
function, `_rekey_malformed_member_ids`, so they cannot mint differently: the
in-memory half on the parsed `cfg.agents` at every load, the on-disk half on the raw
document inside `_apply_document_migrations` (re-decided against the document under
the write lock, idempotent, never overwriting an existing id -- a collision takes the
next `-N` suffix; `default_agent` follows; a `display_name` already stored survives).
The `config.local.json` overlay's agent keys are passed to the on-disk half as
`extra_taken`, so the base document never mints an id the merged view has already
given to an overlay row. The overlay itself is never rewritten, so an overlay row
keyed by a member's PRE-migration name (`agents["case competition"]` overriding the
base row of that key) is re-keyed in memory before the merge by
`_follow_migrated_member_ids_in_overlay`. The mapping it resolves through is the
row's **`legacy_key`** -- the pre-migration key, written verbatim and permanently by
both halves of the re-key (a row created with a well-formed id has none; a malformed
row already carrying one keeps it only when it is a non-empty string -- a junk value
is replaced by the old key, since the overlay re-key follows strings alone and a
preserved junk value would strand the overlay under the old key) -- never the
display name, which a rename changes: the overlay must keep following the member
after the most ordinary operation the split ships. Once the base holds
`case-competition` with `legacy_key: "case competition"`, the overlay row (and an
overlay `default_agent` spelled that way) is read under the id; a key the base still
holds is left for the merge, and a legacy key two rows share (a hand-edited
duplicate) leaves the row where it is. So the member does not split into the
original without its overrides plus a phantom `-2` that re-arms the migration on
every load. `save()` applies the same re-key to the overlay before
`_subtract_overlay`, so the overlay's leaves are recognized under the emitted id and
not copied into the base file. A warning reports the count -- never the keys or the ids minted from them, which are operator-typed text that can be credential-shaped and reach the log surface; the rows to fix carry a `legacy_key`.
`legacy_key` is loader bookkeeping: withheld from the `GET /api/agents` roster
(contract test), masked like the other free-text identity fields on the config
endpoint.

The key is also what a private V2 memory store records as its owner, in three places
that must agree (`memory_stores.owner_member` in config, the store's
`member-memory.json` manifest, the `memory_meta` owner row in the database), so the
migration carries ownership with the key and its ordering is chosen for the crash
case, like the superseded-defaults adoption above:

| Step (all inside the locked read-modify-write) | On failure |
|---|---|
| 1. re-key `agents`, `default_agent`, `memory_stores[*].owner_member` in the document | -- |
| 2. `_reattribute_moved_members(document, moved, overlay stores)`: `memory_stores.rename_private_owner` renames the manifest and the database owner row of EVERY V2 store the member owns -- the base row's binding, every record whose `owner_member` the re-key moved, the store the overlay row keyed by the old name selects, and every store whose record lives only in the overlay's `memory_stores` and names the old key (a record is V2 when either document says so; the overlay is never written back, so a store missed here would keep the legacy owner for good, while the in-memory re-key follows the overlay record's owner on every load) -- each only where it still names the old key | raises -> the config write is skipped; the old key is still in the document, so the **next load re-runs the migration**, mints the same id from the same inputs, and the disk half is a no-op where it already landed |
| 3. write `config.json` | a crash here leaves disk renamed and the document unwritten -- the same recoverable state as step 2 |

Ownership records are therefore never on a different side of a failed write than the
key. `rename_private_owner` never waits on a SQLite lock (`timeout=0`: `load()` runs
synchronously, on the event loop when a handler loads config, so a busy database
is a reason to retry on the next load, not to stall the gateway) and tolerates ONLY a
missing `memory_meta` table (a legacy V1 file with no owner row); a locked or
read-only database propagates and aborts the pass. Both writes happen with the
store's LIFETIME lock held shared (`member_memory_backup.acquire_store_use_lock`'s
lock -- the one every open store holds and a snapshot restore takes exclusively to
swap the directory), taken without waiting and BEFORE the manifest is read (read earlier, a replace landing
between the read and the acquisition would have the pass write a stale owner over
the directory the restore put there): a replace cannot land between the two
writes, and a replace in progress fails the acquisition at once, so the pass aborts
with nothing renamed and the next load retries against whatever the replace put
there. Inside one store the DATABASE row
is renamed first and the manifest second, and a manifest write that fails puts the
row back: the database is the step that fails in ordinary operation (a live session
holds it), so it fails before anything has changed, and the store is whole under the
old owner on either side of the failure. The retry is not guaranteed to mint the same
id -- a same-stem row landing in between shifts the collision suffix -- so a
half-renamed store would be split for good; what remains is a crash between the
disk rename and the config write (step 3) followed by such a row, which the retry
cannot see and which is accepted as a double fault. The step-2 scan requires only the
`agents` map: a base document with no `memory_stores` map at all still has stores to
re-attribute (the row's binding, the overlay's selection, overlay-only records), and
is scanned against an empty map. The DM binding, the rules payload
and a session's `agent` are not re-attributed because their writers validate the
member name against the grammar first: an out-of-grammar row has none of them.

A re-key this load decided but could not write (a contended lock, a degraded load,
an exception) drops the validated-data cache in the ``finally``, exactly like a
superseded-default adoption that did not land: the cache hit reads no overlay
(``local_data = {}``), so a retry served from it would hand the on-disk half an empty
``extra_taken`` and let it mint an id an overlay row already owns. The retry is
therefore always a real read, overlay included.

The in-memory pass and the locked pass agree unless a writer added a row between this
load's read and the locked write; `_persist_config_migration` reports the ids the
locked pass minted (`confirmed_member_moves`, only when its document reached disk) and
`_follow_locked_member_moves` re-keys the parsed config to them, so a load never
serves an id the document does not hold. Pinned end to end in
`test/test_member_identity.py` (`TestLoaderMigration`, `TestMigrationFollowsOwnership`,
`TestMigrationOrderingAndFailures`, `TestMigrationSeesTheOverlay`).

### Per-crew avatar override (`agents.*.avatar`)

`KiroCrewAgentConfig.avatar` is a sparse override, exactly like the per-crew
`model` and `session_color` fields: absent or `{}` means the face is derived from
the crew's name (zero migration). `_safe_avatar` (`config/sections.py`) is the
total coercer applied on load, in the create/update endpoints, and nowhere else,
and it is deliberately NOT re-exported from `loader.py` — the loader's
`from kiro_crew.config.sections import (...)` list is a frozen pre-split snapshot
(`test_config_module_boundaries`), so post-split internals are reached through the
`sections` module. Three accepted shapes:

- `{"kind": "ghost", "traits": {eyes, brows, mouth, accessory, prop: str; blush,
  flip: bool; tile: "#rrggbb"}}` — string traits are truncated to 32 chars and
  are NOT checked against the frontend's trait vocabulary (the renderer resolves
  an unknown option to "absent", so a new hat needs no backend release);
  booleans must be real JSON booleans (`bool("false")` is `True`, so a
  string-typed value is read as `False`); `tile` is the one pinned value — it is
  interpolated into SVG markup, so it goes through the same `#rrggbb` validator
  as `session_color`. An all-empty trait set drops the `traits` key rather than
  storing a featureless third state, and a ghost override left with nothing but
  `kind` collapses to `{}` (the one canonical "reset" spelling). `traits` is
  therefore optional: `{"kind": "ghost", "sounds": {...}}` is valid and means
  "name-derived face, plus these per-state reactions". The ghost is the ONE tier
  that carries `motions` and `sounds` (below).
- `{"kind": "image", "v": <int>, "file": "<16-hex>.<png|jpg|webp>"}` — the crew
  wears an uploaded picture served from `GET /api/agents/{name}/avatar`; the
  file itself lives under `<data home>/run/avatars/` and the record only marks
  the choice. A picture has no face to move, so it carries no `motions`; it does
  still carry `sounds`, because the shipped renderer plays a crew-record cue
  whatever face it draws (`CrewStateAvatar.tsx` reads `soundsFrom(avatar)`
  kind-agnostically). Retiring the key here ahead of that renderer would silence a
  crew on an unrelated save with no way to restore the sound. `v` (a positive real int; `True` is rejected) is the cache-busting
  mtime stamp the frontend appends as `?v=`; `file` pins the exact committed,
  content-addressed variant and must match `^[0-9a-f]{16}\.(png|jpg|webp)$`.
  Wire-only keys (`promote`, `token`) never reach the record.
- `{"kind": "pack", "id": "<pack id>"}` — the crew wears an appearance pack from
  the crew library (`GET /api/appearances`, specified in
  `learn-cron-dashboard.md`, *Crew appearance library*). `id` is validated by
  `appearance_packs.safe_pack_id`, the SAME function the pack store applies to a
  directory name, so a value that persists here can always be looked up; a
  second copy of the character class is what would drift. A junk id collapses the
  whole override to `{}` rather than storing `{"kind": "pack"}`: a pack avatar IS
  its id, so an override naming no art has nothing to render. Whether the pack
  still EXISTS is deliberately not checked — config load must not touch the disk,
  and a pack deleted out of band would otherwise make the whole config unloadable
  instead of making one face fall back — so a dangling id renders as the
  name-derived ghost on the client. A pack carries its own per-state art
  (`GET /api/appearances/{id}/slot/{slot}`) and its own per-state audio
  (`GET /api/appearances/{id}/sound/{state}`), so it needs no `motions` on the
  record. It keeps accepting `sounds` for the same reason the picture tier does --
  that key is audible today on every tier -- and retires it in the change that
  makes the pack's own audio what plays. **A pack survives a faceless save.** The
  shipped crew editor rebuilds the override from a closed ghost/picture shape,
  so for a pack-wearing crew it renders the name-derived face and any unrelated
  save (a model change, a colour) submits `{}` — or `{"kind": "ghost", ...}`
  carrying only the ghost tier's own reactions — which read as reset would
  silently clear a pack set through the API. `PUT /api/agents/{name}` therefore
  keeps the current pack id when the record is a pack and the save names no face
  (`handlers/agents._carry_pack_through_faceless_save`), and rides the save's
  `expressions` and `sounds` onto the kept pack: both are legal on every tier, a
  faceless save is the one way the shipped editor can change them on a pack crew,
  and a pack's own cue answers a different route (`/sound/{state}`) than a
  crew-record cue does, so the two do not collide. Only `motions` is left
  behind, because it is the ghost's alone. It is narrow: ghost and picture keep
  their reset semantics; `avatar: null` (which the editor never sends) is
  still an explicit reset that takes the pack off; a real face — a ghost with
  traits, a picture, another pack — replaces it. The carve-out exists until the
  picker can display a pack, at which point the editor round-trips it itself.
  **A ghost's `motions` survive a save that does not name them** for the same
  reason (`handlers/agents._carry_motions_through_motionless_save`): the shipped
  editor rebuilds a ghost draft from the axes it can draw and submits exactly
  those, so a `motions` pick set through the API would be erased by the next
  unrelated save with no click that meant it. The rule is the tri-state
  `save_pack` gives a pack's cues — a payload with NO `motions` key leaves the
  stored ones alone, a payload naming the key (`{}` included) replaces them —
  and it applies only when the stored record and the validated save are both
  ghosts: a tier change is a real face replacing the old one and `motions` is the
  ghost's alone, and a reset (`null`, `{}`, the all-empty collapse) means reset.
  It retires with the frontend change that submits `motions` itself.

**Per-state reactions (`motions`, `sounds`).** Where a reaction may be stored
follows from which tier can play it, and the two keys differ. `motions` is the
GHOST's alone: it names a built-in animation of a trait-composed face, so a
picture has nothing to move and a pack animates from its own files. `sounds` is
legal on EVERY tier, because the shipped renderer reads a crew-record cue
kind-agnostically — so this is the one reaction key that is not the ghost's. Both
are keyed on the agent lifecycle state (`working`, `done`, `error` exactly; any other
key is dropped, so a version-skewed caller cannot grow the key set):

- `motions: {"done"?: "none"|"bounce"|"nod"|"sparkle", "error"?: "none"|"shake"|"cross-eyes"|"droop"}`
  — a built-in reaction animation the frontend implements. Each state has its OWN
  vocabulary (`_AVATAR_MOTIONS`) and a value from the other state's list is
  dropped: `{"done": "shake"}` would play a failure animation on success, which is
  not what its author wrote. There is no `working` entry — the ghost's working
  animation is its idle breathing, and a reaction fires on a transition. `"none"`
  is kept as explicit stillness, distinct from an absent state, so one state can
  opt out of a motion the others use.
- `sounds: {"<state>": "none"|"chime"|"ding"|"blip"|"pop"|"pulse"}` — a
  synthesized cue preset. Unlike a trait value this IS pinned to a vocabulary,
  because the name selects a shipped preset rather than an option the renderer can
  resolve to absent. `"none"` is explicit silence, distinct from an absent state
  (also silent). No per-crew audio upload exists: a crew that needs its own audio
  wears a pack, which carries its own.

Either key is omitted from the record when validation leaves it empty, so a
stored avatar never carries `{}` for one, and a key illegal on this tier is
DROPPED rather than refused — `{"kind": "image", "motions": {...}}` loads as a
bare picture. No stored cue is lost by that rule: `sounds` stays legal wherever it
already worked, so an existing picture- or pack-wearing crew keeps the sound its
owner chose. Junk (`motions: "x"`, `sounds: {"working": 5}`, a list) is stripped
silently and never refused: the same forgiveness traits get, so a malformed
reaction costs that reaction and never the crew's whole avatar. `expressions`
(a per-state `eyes`/`mouth` pick, which `motions` supersedes) round-trips on
EVERY tier — `{"<state>": {"eyes"?: str, "mouth"?: str}}`, only those two
axes, 32-char truncation, empty strings dropped — because the shipped renderer
still draws it on a ghost and the shipped builder still SUBMITS it on a picture
or a pack, so stripping it there would erase a pick a ghost → picture → ghost
round-trip then cannot restore; a value a user can see is not dropped ahead of
the renderer that shows it, and the frontend change that removes the picker is
where it retires. `sounds` stays for the same reason on every tier, and only
`motions` is tier-gated. The roster leaves all three keys intact rather than masking them
(`_roster_avatar`), for the same reason it leaves `file` intact — a value pinned
to a closed vocabulary is not user-authored text, and masking it would break the
reaction while destroying nothing an attacker could have put there.

Anything else — a non-dict, an unknown `kind`, a ghost override carrying no
trait, motion or sound that survives validation — collapses to `{}` on load (config.json is hand-editable and
agent-writable, so junk must never crash the load), while the endpoints answer a
non-empty raw value the coercer collapses with 400 `invalid_avatar` — except a
well-formed ghost override whose traits all coerce to absent, which is the
validator's own all-empty → reset rule rather than caller junk and so stores as
the canonical reset. The staging
and commit protocol behind the image tier is specified in
`learn-cron-dashboard.md` (*Crew avatars*).

### Computer use: no `enabled` field here

`ComputerUseConfig` carries display and limits only. The switch for native desktop
GUI automation lives **outside `config.json`**, on the keystone at
`~/.kiro/crew/computer_use.json` (path via `config.loader.computer_use_state_path()`,
leaf on `security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`):

```json
{
  "enabled": false,
  "allowed_apps": [],
  "extra_denied_apps": []
}
```

The absence is deliberate and the precedent is `denied_commands.json`:
`is_sensitive_write_path("~/.kiro/crew/config.json")` is `True` (the *tool* path is
protected), but `is_sensitive_bash_command("echo x > ~/.kiro/crew/config.json")` is
`None` — `config.json` is not among `_WRITE_PROTECTED_BASH_LEAVES` (which fences
only a few specific control files elsewhere under the home). A config
toggle would therefore be flippable by a prompt-injected agent through any shell
redirect.

- **`enabled`** — the primary enable for full desktop observation plus input
  synthesis. A security ceiling, so it goes where the agent can neither read nor
  write it. Read with a strict `is True` identity test, so a truthy string such as
  `"enabled": "false"` does **not** enable desktop control, and the read fails soft
  to `{}` → **off**.
- **`allowed_apps` / `extra_denied_apps`** — the operator's own narrowing. These
  are the ONLY other keys `PolicyConfig.from_state` reads.

**There is no `allow_pointer_move` key, and writing one has no effect.** An earlier
revision documented it here as a second consent switch for `click_method: "global"`
(the one path that warps the real mouse pointer), gated together with a
`capabilities.computer_use_pointer` governance row. Both were removed by product
decision: there are no `computer_use.*` governance scopes at all, and
`from_state` reads only the three keys above, so a hand-written
`{"enabled": true, "allow_pointer_move": false}` silently grants the pointer path —
the operator would believe they had withheld consent. What actually contains that
path is that the model must NAME the method (`auto` never resolves onto it) and every
use is SEL-audited under its own `tool_kind`. Do not re-document the flag without
re-implementing it. See [security.md](security.md), [governance.md](governance.md)
and [computer-use.md](computer-use.md).

#### `computer_use.cursor_motion` — the one new `config.json` flag

Cursor Motion (the cosmetic fake-cursor desktop overlay) is the exception that
proves the rule above: it belongs in `config.json` precisely *because* it grants no
capability. `computer_use.cursor_motion` is a **display preference, default OFF** —
the overlay draws an image, never moves the pointer, cannot deliver input, and is
invisible to `screencapture`, so an agent flipping it could at most decorate its own
clicks. A keystone flag would imply a security decision that does not exist.

`overlay.cursor_motion_enabled()` reads it through `getattr(section,
"cursor_motion", False)` **even though the field is now declared** on
`ComputerUseConfig`, and that stays deliberate: it makes the read
**forward-compatible and fail-OFF**: a build whose `ComputerUseConfig` predates the
field resolves to OFF rather than raising inside a tool call, and a missing field can
only ever mean "no decoration", never "start drawing on the user's screen".

Three consequences for this module: `"computer_use"` MUST be present in
`_KNOWN_CONFIG_SECTIONS` (the guarded invariant that `to_dict()`'s emitted sections
equal that set); the dashboard's `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` exposes only the limits
(`computer_use.max_tree_nodes`, `computer_use.screenshot_max_px`) — never an
`enabled` key; and every numeric knob is clamped to
the same `*_LIMIT` ceiling the MCP tool schemas enforce, so a hand-edited
`config.json` cannot ask for an unbounded accessibility walk or a full-resolution
screenshot.

### Security-Bounded Config Clamp

Resource-limit and timeout knobs are clamped to hard ceilings **at load time**, not
just at the dashboard write gate. The ceilings are owned beside the field models
in `sections.py` and re-exported by `loader.py`; the load-time clamp remains in
`loader.py`:

| Constant | Value | Field |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `SUBAGENT_AUTO_MAX_CEILING` | 64 | `agent.subagent_auto_max`, `agent.max_subagents` |
| `SUBAGENT_MAX_TURNS_CEILING` | 1000 | `agent.subagent_max_turns` |
| `SUBAGENT_TIMEOUT_MIN` / `SUBAGENT_TIMEOUT_MAX` | 60 / 86400 | `agent.subagent_timeout_secs` |
| `POOL_SIZE_MAX` | 10 | `session.pool_size` |
| `CHAT_TURN_TIMEOUT_MIN` / `_MAX` | 300 / 86400 | `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs` |
| `TOOL_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MIN` / `_MAX` | 30 / 7200 | `agent.tool_approval_timeout_secs` |

`_SECURITY_BOUNDED_FIELDS` lists each `(section, key, min, max)`; the mins match
the existing runtime floors (0/1) so a legitimate in-range value is never
altered. `_clamp_security_bounds(data)` runs **once on the disk-read (cache-miss)
path, before the validated dict is cached** — so subsequent cache hits already
serve clamped values. It clamps out-of-range real integers in place (a JSON
`true`/`false` bool or any non-int is skipped and left to dataclass
coercion/defaults), logs a WARNING, and emits a best-effort `config_bounds_clamped`
SEL security event (never fatal — config loading must not raise).

Two **cross-field** clamps run after that generic pass, so both operands are
already in range:

- `agent.max_subagents`: 0 is the auto-size sentinel, so an explicit pin below
  `MAX_SUBAGENTS_FIXED_FLOOR` (3) is raised UP to the floor.
- `agent.tool_approval_timeout_secs` is pulled to `APPROVAL_TURN_MARGIN_SECS`
  (60) below `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs`. An approval window that reaches the
  turn ceiling can never fire: the turn is cut first and reports itself as a turn
  timeout, so the unanswered approval is never named and an unattended run burns
  the whole ceiling on every prompt. `dashboard/turn_dispatch.py`
  `tool_approval_timeout_secs()` repeats the cap against the **resolved** ceiling,
  which the ACP prompt timeout can lower below the configured one, and then
  against the budget REMAINING in the running turn (`_TURN_DEADLINE`, published by
  `_bounded_turn`). The arm-time bound is the one that makes the invariant hold
  for a prompt arming late in a long turn; with under a margin left it returns
  `0.0` and the runner declines without waiting.

Why load-time (not just the API): the REST API rejects out-of-range writes, but a
direct edit of `config.json` (any process running as the same OS user — including
a prompt-injected agent with file-write access) bypassed that gate entirely. Each
knob controls a resource-consumption dimension (concurrent subagent processes,
per-subagent turn budget, pre-warmed pool processes), so an inflated on-disk value
could exhaust host memory/CPU/the process table (DoS). The dashboard write gate
(`dashboard/handlers/core.py`) and the runtime pool cap **import these same
constants**, so write-gate / load-clamp / runtime-cap cannot drift apart —
closing the direct-config-edit DoS gap.

### `resource_limits`: one block, three mechanisms, two meanings of `0`

`ResourceLimitsConfig` (`config/sections.py`, re-exported by
`config/loader.py`) carries the kernel confinement ceilings for spawned agent
processes. It is the one config block whose keys are
read by more than one enforcement mechanism, and two of those keys mean
**different things** to two of them:

| Key | POSIX rlimit (`security.apply_resource_limits`) | cgroup v2 scope (`sandbox.cgroup_scope_argv`) | xdist (`resource_status`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_open_files` | `RLIMIT_NOFILE`; `0` = leave inherited | — | — |
| `max_processes` | `RLIMIT_NPROC`; `0` = leave inherited | `TasksMax` (counts THREADS); `0` = use default | — |
| `max_memory_mb` | `RLIMIT_AS`; `0` = leave inherited | `MemoryMax`; `0` = use default | — |
| `max_cpu_seconds` | `RLIMIT_CPU`; `0` = leave inherited | — | — |
| `cpu_weight` | — | `CPUWeight`, 1..10000 | — |
| `max_cpu_percent` | — | `CPUQuota`, opt-in: unset emits no property | — |
| `max_total_memory_mb` | — | slice `MemoryMax` (all trees together) | — |
| `max_total_processes` | — | slice `TasksMax` | — |
| `xdist_auto_cap` | — | — | `-1` auto, `0` off, `N` fixed |

`0` cannot be normalised away in either direction. On the rlimit path it is a
documented request ("leave the inherited limit unchanged") with existing configs
behind it; on the cgroup path systemd **rejects** a zero property and the scope
never starts, so `0` there has to mean "use the module default" and the ceiling
is never left unset. Every field is therefore `int | None`, and `None` ("not
configured") stays distinct from `0`.

Defaults deliberately do NOT live in the dataclass. Each mechanism keeps its own
(`security._RLIMIT_DEFAULTS`, `sandbox._CGROUP_DEFAULT_*` /
`_default_max_memory_mb()`), because a copy here would be a third default set
that could drift from both.

**Single parse site.** `ResourceLimitsConfig.from_raw()` is the only code that
coerces these keys; `_limit_int` is its rule. Before #3474 six readers each had
their own, which is how the two meanings of `0` drifted apart with nothing
recording it. The rule: bools are not numbers (`True` would become a 1-task
ceiling); a non-integral float truncates toward zero (`512.5` -> `512`, so a
stricter parse can never loosen a ceiling); a value in `(0, 1)` is REFUSED
because `int()` would turn it into the `0` that already means something else;
NaN and `±Infinity` (both producible by `json.loads`) are refused before `int()`
can raise on them; and an out-of-range value is refused rather than clamped, so
a confinement ceiling is never silently moved away from the number in the
operator's file. Every refusal is logged once per key per process.

`test_resource_limits_schema.py::TestSingleParseSite` fails if a seventh reader
appears.

### Dashboard theme persistence

`DashboardConfig.theme_mode` / `theme_color` / `onboarded` are workspace-persistent
(shared across ports and devices) rather than browser-local. The frontend reads
them at boot via `GET /api/theme/boot`; empty `theme_mode`/`theme_color` mean
unset (the frontend falls back to `localStorage` or the built-in default).

### Interactive model picker visibility

`DashboardConfig.model_picker_hidden_models` is a workspace-persistent list of
model IDs hidden from interactive chat model pickers. The default is `[]`, which
shows the full advertised list. The loader accepts only string arrays, trims and
deduplicates entries, and ignores empty strings and `auto`. The dashboard PUT
endpoint applies the shared model-ID grammar and a bounded list length. Changes
apply to ChatPage and ChatPane without a restart; they do not alter `/api/models`,
entitlement, defaults, role or fallback models, bulk switching, crew editors, or
app-specific selectors. `model_picker_configured` records the first successful
visibility save and is read-only through the dashboard API; the same atomic write
that replaces the hidden list sets it. Existing configurations with a non-empty,
valid hidden list migrate to configured, while an empty or invalid legacy value
does not dismiss the first-use shortcut.

### Dashboard UI language

`DashboardConfig.language` selects the dashboard interface language. It rides the
same two endpoints as the theme fields — surfaced by `GET /api/theme/boot`
(unauthenticated, so the SPA can pick a language before the token flow completes
and avoid an English flash) and written by `PUT /api/config/theme`
(`{"language": "<tag>"}`). Both responses are built by one helper
(`handlers/core.py::_theme_payload`), so every read site returns the same shape.

Resolution precedence, implemented in `website/src/i18n/detect.ts`:

1. this config value (mirrored into `localStorage['mc-lang']` for a synchronous
   first paint),
2. the browser's `navigator.languages`, matched exact-then-primary-subtag
   (so `zh`/`zh-Hans` resolve to `zh-CN`),
3. `en`.

`""` is a first-class value meaning **auto-detect**, not "missing" — the picker's
Auto option writes `""` to clear a previous explicit choice. An explicit choice
always outranks detection, so a user who selects English on a zh-CN machine is
not re-detected back to Chinese on the next load.

A cross-tab `storage` event is also an explicit user choice. Once one arrives,
`LanguageProvider` refuses to adopt the older `/api/theme/boot` response that may
still be in flight, so the UI, local mirror, and workspace write cannot diverge
because of response ordering.

The picker's Auto row is labelled plain **"Auto"**, not "Auto (follow browser)".
The desktop app has no browser preference to follow — its locale comes from the
OS — so naming the browser was wrong on that surface. The row annotates itself
with the language Auto actually resolves to ("Auto — Deutsch"), which answers the
question accurately on every surface.

The backend's **write path** validates **shape only** (`_LANGUAGE_TAG_RE`, a
conservative BCP-47 subset), not membership in the set of shipped catalogs — a
well-formed tag with no catalog stays writable and falls back to detection
client-side. The **agent-injection read path** additionally requires catalog
membership: `context.ui_language_tag()` checks the tag against
`context._UI_LANGUAGE_CATALOGS` (a mirror of the non-dev-only
`SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` entries) and treats a non-catalog tag exactly like
`""`/Auto — no `[UI LANGUAGE]` steer is emitted, so the agent is never steered
to a language the chrome cannot render (#1130). Adding a language is therefore
the three frontend edits — add `locales/<tag>.json`, register the picker entry
in `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`, and add the static import plus `AUTHORED_CATALOGS`
entry in `i18n/catalogs.ts` — **plus one mechanical backend entry** in
`_UI_LANGUAGE_CATALOGS`, which the drift gate in
`test/test_context_ui_language.py` names explicitly on failure.

Shipped catalogs (ordered by global speaker count, which is also the picker
order): `en`, `zh-CN`, `hi`, `es`, `fr`, `bn`, `pt`, `ru`, `de`, `ja`, `ko`, `it`. Right-to-left
languages are deliberately **not** shipped yet: the catalogs would translate
fine, but the dashboard's layout uses physical-direction utilities (`pl-*`,
`left-*`, `text-left`) and unmirrored directional icons, so an RTL locale would
render correct text in a visibly wrong shell. RTL requires `dir="rtl"` plus a
logical-property conversion first.

All catalogs are **statically bundled**, so `t()` stays synchronous (see the
rationale in `website/src/i18n/index.ts`). The cost is that every user downloads
every language: at 8592 keys the catalogs share one chunk that is **~173 KB gzip
per catalog, ~2.0 MB gzip for the twelve combined** (`npm run analyze`, then gzip
the `assets/t-*.js` chunk). This is tolerable only because the dashboard is served
from a loopback gateway — over a network it is already past the point of
justification, and each further catalog adds another ~173 KB to every user's first
load regardless of the language they read.

The documented next step is therefore to keep `en` static and lazily fetch the
active non-English catalog. That seam is already isolated to
`website/src/i18n/catalogs.ts` — the module that owns every catalog import — plus
a `<Suspense>` boundary in `main.tsx`; no call site changes, and
`registerCatalogs()` is where a fetching backend hands its catalog over.
**Catalog #13 belongs behind that seam**: Korean is #12 and the last one this
chunk absorbs in front of it. Re-measure when the seam lands — the figure above
is what says whether it worked.

#### The tag reaches the agent, too

`context.py::_build_ui_language_section` injects the configured tag — after the
catalog-membership gate described above — into session
context as a `[UI LANGUAGE] <tag>` block (next to `[CURRENT AGENT]`/`[RUNTIME]`,
and in `minimal_context` mode as well). It exists for one string: the tool-call
purpose (`__tool_use_purpose`), which the dashboard paints as the tool-call pill
label and the messaging renderers reuse as the task title. That is the only piece
of model-generated prose rendered as *chrome*, and without the block the model
has nothing to go on and mirrors the language the user typed in — an inferred
signal that flips mid-session the moment the user pastes an English stack trace,
and one that persists, since purposes are stored in session history.

Reading it back off the wire matches by **shape**, not by a list of literals.
kiro-cli injects the `__tool_use_purpose` property into every tool schema it
exposes, and echoes it back in `rawInput` as either that name or a camelCased
`__toolUsePurpose` — but nothing validates the key, and the model paraphrases
it: `__purpose`, `__thinking_purpose` and `__woohoo_purpose` all appear in real
transcripts. `acp/_dispatch.py::extract_tool_purpose` prefers the canonical
spellings in `acp/types.py::TOOL_PURPOSE_KEYS`, then accepts any *reserved*
(dunder-prefixed) key whose name ends in `purpose`
(`_dispatch.py::is_tool_purpose_key`), scanned in sorted order so the reading is
deterministic. It is the single reader for both transports; matching literals
drops the purpose for every paraphrased spelling, and the concise pill silently
falls back to the raw command line while the unrecognized key leaks into the
arguments view as if it were a real parameter. The dunder prefix is what keeps a
tool's own functional `purpose` argument out of the match.
`website/src/utils/toolPurpose.ts` is the frontend mirror, used by the
pending-approval preview and the Mochi approval bubble.

Three properties are load-bearing:

- **`""` injects nothing.** Auto is resolved client-side by `detect.ts`; the
  backend does not know the outcome, so there is no truthful value to inject and
  un-configured installs keep byte-identical context.
- **The raw tag is injected, not a display name.** A backend code→name table
  would be a second list to keep in sync with `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` and would
  degrade to the tag for anything missing from it regardless. Raw is not
  unchecked: the builder re-validates the shape (`_UI_LANGUAGE_TAG_RE`, a
  superset-safe local mirror of `_LANGUAGE_TAG_RE`) and drops anything that is
  not tag-shaped. `PUT /api/config/theme` is not the only way a value reaches
  the field — the loader coerces whatever the JSON holds into `str`, so a
  hand-edited `"language": null` arrives as the literal `"None"` — and a value
  that lands in the system prompt should not depend on its writer having
  validated it.
- **Scope is the purpose text only.** The block says so explicitly, because
  widening it would collide with the base prompt's rule to reply in the user's
  language.

It is best-effort steering with no enforcement path: nothing validates the
language a model actually emits.

#### The tag also names the session

Auto-titling (`dashboard/chat_title.py`) asks a background model for the session
name that renders in the chat sidebar, and that name is chrome by the same
argument as the tool-call purpose above: the date group headers, filter labels and
rename menu around it are all in the UI language, and the name is *persisted*, so
one written in the conversation's language leaves two languages on the row for
good. With no directive the model simply mirrors the language of the prompt it was
given — measured on `claude-haiku-4.5`, a fully Chinese conversation is named
"Chat Title Language Mismatch".

The tag reaches the titler through the **prompt**, not the `[UI LANGUAGE]` block:
titling runs on the shared `_bg` session, and that block scopes itself explicitly
to tool-call purpose text. `chat_title._ui_language()` resolves the same tag
through the shared `context.ui_language_tag()`, and `_build_title_prompt()`
interpolates a directive into the prompt's `{language}` slot — outside the
delimited transcript, so a message that quotes the directive cannot restate it.
`""` omits the slot entirely and the prompt stays byte-identical to the one
auto-language workspaces have always sent.

Two consequences fall out of naming in a non-latin script:

- **The prose guard needs a second ceiling.** `_looks_like_prose` rejects a reply
  that is a sentence rather than a name, and its word ceiling counts
  `str.split()` tokens — which is 1 for any length of Chinese, Japanese or Thai.
  `_TITLE_MAX_UNSPACED_CHARS` bounds those scripts by character instead, counting
  only unspaced-script characters so latin identifiers in a mixed title stay
  free, and the full-width terminators `。！？` are matched without the ASCII
  rule's trailing-whitespace requirement (those scripts do not space after
  punctuation). A short refusal with no terminator remains a documented false
  negative for those unspaced scripts. Korean is spaced, so the word ceiling
  bounds its long sentences, but a SHORT Korean refusal clears every other
  check -- and Korean puts the refusal verb last, so English-style prefix
  openers cannot catch it. `_looks_like_prose` therefore also matches Korean
  sentence shape: the sentence-final polite conjugations
  (`_TITLE_KO_SENTENCE_ENDINGS`, the formal "-nida" family and the
  informal-polite "-yo" family) plus the apology opener
  (`_TITLE_KO_PROSE_OPENERS`), which a title as a noun phrase never carries. A
  plain-form (banmal) Korean refusal remains a documented false negative, and
  a sentence-form Korean title loses to the fallback name -- the deliberate
  direction of the trade, since a fallback name is still the user's own words
  while a stored refusal is the bug.
- **The reveal animation needs characters.** The sidebar types a new title in one
  word at a time; a single-token title skipped the animation entirely, so
  `_title_reveal_prefixes` steps unspaced scripts two characters at a time
  instead, landing in the same step count as an equivalent latin title.

`_clean_title` strips the full-width and CJK quote/period forms (`「」`, `“”`,
`。`) alongside the ASCII ones, since that is what a zh/ja reply wraps a name in.
It also keeps the reply's first line only -- the rule
`messaging/auto_title.clean_title` states as "Keeps the first line only" -- so a
`SKIP` verdict followed by a reason collapses back to the bare control word.
`_validate_title_reply` treats BOTH taught control words (`SKIP`, `KEEP`) as
no-title sentinels on every path, matched case-insensitively, alone or with a
punctuation-separated reason on one line (`_is_verdict_reply`) -- while a real
title that merely opens with the word ("SKIP and KEEP handling", "KEEP-ALIVE
header bug") survives.

### Foreign-agent import onboarding state

`DashboardConfig.import_onboarded` is a separate workspace-persistent gate from
`dashboard.onboarded`. The import gate controls the first-run foreign-agent
review; `onboarded` continues to control the existing theme/feature onboarding.
The import gate is evaluated first. Completing or skipping import sets only
`import_onboarded`; it does not silently complete the later onboarding.

For backward compatibility, a config that omits `dashboard.import_onboarded`
is migrated from `dashboard.onboarded`. An already-onboarded user therefore
starts with `import_onboarded=true` and retains legacy status past the new first-run
gate, while a new or not-yet-onboarded workspace sees import before the existing
onboarding. `GET /api/theme/boot` exposes the resolved `import_onboarded` boolean
alongside the existing non-secret theme boot fields.

The frontend also recognizes the older browser-only `mc-onboarded` marker when
no `mc-import-onboarded` marker exists. Before applying false server defaults,
it persists both onboarding flags through `PUT /api/config/theme`; an explicit
newer import marker remains a cache only and continues to yield to server state.

Foreign settings are never deep-merged into `config.json`. The importer applies
only its explicit non-security settings allowlist, preserves every existing
KiroCrew value on collision, and reports unsupported or secret-bearing source
settings without copying them. Foreign credentials, security policy,
approval/sandbox settings, agent/runtime state, hooks, and arbitrary unknown
config sections cannot enter configuration through this path.

### `ChannelConfig.from_dict(data: dict) -> ChannelConfig`
Parses a channel config entry from JSON. Invalid activation values fall back to `"mention"`.

### `KiroCrewConfig.channel_config(channel_id: str) -> ChannelConfig`
Returns the effective config for a channel:
1. Explicit entry in `slack_channels` → returned as-is
2. DM channel (`D`-prefix) → `ChannelConfig(activation=slack_dm_activation)`
3. Group/public channel (`C`/`G`-prefix) → `ChannelConfig(activation="mention")`

The `dashboard.url` field controls where the dashboard is reachable. From it, the system derives the port to bind on, the bind address (`0.0.0.0` for non-loopback hosts, `127.0.0.1` otherwise), and the allowed origins for CSRF/WebSocket checks. When omitted, defaults to `localhost:5476`.

A **malformed** `dashboard.url` (e.g. an unterminated IPv6 literal `http://[::1` or a non-numeric port `http://host:notaport`) does **not** abort startup: `parse_dashboard_url` degrades to the defaults (`""` host, port `5476`) and logs a warning, so a single typo in the config can never take the gateway down on boot. `KIROCREW_PORT` still overrides the port regardless.

Once the dashboard's TCP site is listening, the gateway **exports the
actually-bound port as `KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT`** into its own environment, so
every child it spawns (kiro-cli sessions and their MCP stdio servers) inherits
the truth instead of re-deriving a guess from `dashboard.url` — a portless URL
would otherwise collapse to the default port in the child even when the
gateway is bound elsewhere (including `--port auto`, where the OS assigns the
port and no config field ever names it). It is a **distinct variable from
`KIROCREW_PORT`** on purpose: `KIROCREW_PORT` means operator intent and is
persisted by `service_environment()` into unit files, while
`KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT` is ephemeral observed truth that must never be frozen
into persistent config. Clients read it via `port_resolution.resolve_client_port`,
one precedence step below the operator override.

## Model Resolution Chain

When `agent.model` is `"auto"` (default):

1. `~/.kiro/agents/kirocrew.json` → `model` field (installed agent config)
2. `config_package_dir()/defaults.json` → `model` field (bundled `src/kiro_crew/config/defaults.json`)
3. Falls back to `DEFAULT_MODEL` (passed through to provider)

## Error Handling

- Missing file → defaults
- Invalid JSON → defaults (warning logged)
- Missing fields → individual defaults
