# Crews

A **crew** is a named entry in the config's `agents` map. It binds a kiro-cli
agent template plus a workspace, a memory store, a model and a reasoning effort,
and it carries free-text `triggers` that decide whether the orchestrator may
route work to it. The selection path is the `select_crew` MCP tool.

This spec used to own a second thing spelled *crew*: **Crew Mode**, the
`"crew"` chat-slot mode whose control plane (`crew_chat.py`) fanned one
session's topics out to sub-sessions. It is retired — see
[Retired: Crew Mode](#retired-crew-mode) — in favour of the Crew Members page
(`/members`, served by `dashboard/handlers/members.py` and `members.py` in the
table below), where each crew is a standing agent with its own thread.

A crew is not a *Remote Instance* (see [instances.md](instances.md)), and not
an Issue Radar *crew*, which is that app's own repository work crew
(see [issue-radar.md](issue-radar.md)).

## Components

Legacy topic respawn requires its original run identity or surviving legacy
run state. If pruning removed both, continuation refuses with a named memory
error and leaves the queued request retryable; the owner must start a new topic.
Missing history must never silently turn a private topic into Global memory.

## Owner-reviewed capability inheritance

`agent_capabilities.py` resolves one verified Parent and explicit per-item
`set`, `remove` and `inherit` intent. The owner-only GET, POST preview and PUT
routes at `/api/agents/{name}/capabilities` use schema version 1. Preview ends
in `/preview`; PUT requires its opaque preview token and the GET revision.
Unknown fields, null sets, stale sources and ambiguous names are refused.

Enrollment is explicit. Shared members follow their selected Parent; a legacy
private snapshot starts with every existing row local and every absent Parent
row removed. Restoring one row leaves all other overrides intact. MCP transport
replacement is whole-value; autoApprove is separate. Skills preserve manual
resources and cannot change tool or approval lists. An exclusion still covered
by a wildcard or another approval list is refused instead of claimed effective.
Ordinary upstream changes reconcile through the same resolver. New capabilities,
transport changes and broader approvals stay pending owner acceptance. Local
conflicts retain their usable values: accepting a Parent row moves only the
accepted Parent baseline, an explicit local override on that row keeps applying
on top of it, and an `inherit` or restore on that row adopts the current
Parent value and advances that row's accepted baseline. Selected Parent rows can be accepted for
several already-enrolled members of the same exact Parent in one request. The
editor offers those members as a checklist drawn from the declared crew roster
(the current member excluded); the backend alone decides eligibility and
answers `member_parent_mismatch` for a member outside this exact Parent. The
checklist hint says only that the names are declared members and that
eligibility is verified at review; it never calls a listed member eligible. The
pane's mode badge names the persisted following mode without a `Saved:` prefix;
the separate saved/unsaved badge reports draft state. Ticking Follow changes the
draft, not that persisted mode badge.
The preview lists every member the reviewed request covers, the current
member first, and states "no effective changes" for a member whose local overrides
absorb the accepted rows, so the impact list never speaks only about other
members. The Parent checkbox says "Accept this parent change". Each Parent row
shows separate selection feedback and a Source-cause outcome, both while checked
and unchecked. Selection feedback explicitly says save accepts the change for
this member and selected peers, keeping their overrides; unchecked feedback says
Source changes still apply on save. The shared hint explains acceptance removes
the pending change, while Source Inherited adopts the new Parent value and
Override/Removed retain their choices. An explicit `inherit` draft operation
adopts the current Parent even when acceptance is unchecked. Outcomes use the
draft's actual Source first, then the saved row state, not the old conflict flag;
saved Inherited rows without acceptance wait, while explicit draft inheritance
adopts the current value or Parent removal. The visible `local` state label is
Override; its API value remains `local`. The receipt then
names each kept row under the current member, derived only from the reviewed
selection, the server view's conflict flag and the sanitized preview projection
(a row still `local` and present, or still `removed` and absent, with no impact
entry), and shows Override or Stays removed beside its reference; it
never prints a value, never reads the raw draft, and never invents kept-row
details for a peer member, whose rows the response does not project. An
Inherited row that follows a Parent removal is never labelled as a kept local
choice; it is an impact entry when its effective presence changes.
The Follow checkbox places the unchanged-until-save and value/empty-field
preservation guarantee beside the control; one state-carrying helper explains
checked means overrides are editable and unchecked means read-only, replacing
the duplicate enrollment callout. Both are accessible descriptions while the
checkbox's accessible name stays stable. The label explicitly targets the native
checkbox id, so clicking its text toggles enrollment. Conflict and receipt prose wraps at
word boundaries; long code references can break anywhere. The transport option
is "Command (local process)"; the conflict badge says "Conflicts with your
override", distinct from the Override row state. Reload retrieves the server view
without moving the draft's revision; "Use the new version for this draft" moves
that revision and invalidates a prior preview, but does not review or save.
Review and atomic save remain separate steps. Receipt counts use registered
locale-specific plural forms. The approval helper states that
making a tool available does not auto-approve it. Empty approval
section headings are hidden, but their selector choices and draft additions
remain available. Hidden transport leaves are
labelled "Hidden value kept. Type to replace." rather than a phrase that
competes with the Inherited/Local/Removed state words. The editor's close
guard names the member whose edits are unsaved and says no other member is
affected, since one editor holds one member's draft.

Each owner save writes new private spec identities and switches all selected
bindings through one config-delta publication. Failed config publication keeps
the prior valid bindings and specs; staged definitions remain private. Preview
values redact credential containers. The existing governance sanitizer still
runs at publication. Withheld shortcuts become tombstones, so a later policy
relaxation does not resurrect them automatically.

`prepare_member_capabilities(member, project_dir)` verifies the saved spec and
Parent identity without claiming that a provider loaded it. API runtime state
remains pending or unverified until runtime integration supplies observations.
The existing fork refresh delegates enrolled definitions to this resolver.
Legacy PATCH and direct rebind refuse an enrolled definition rather than
bypassing its intent. Unreadable authoritative state returns bounded
`503 capabilities_unavailable`; the final PATCH guard runs under the spec lock
before bookkeeping. A late legacy publish rebind refusal retains the old binding
and rolls back its staged destination, not a claim that no writes occurred.
Runtime views are projected from allocation-owned state through the public
`SessionManager.capability_runtime_view` facade; response rows expose no mutable
registry dictionaries. The existing whole-reset button explicitly restores the
verified current Parent through the capability transaction. Publish flattens
only the saved valid snapshot, without accepting pending Parent expansions or
exporting inheritance metadata. Publish records its member, source and target
snapshot identities in the existing sidecar before creating the destination or
committing the binding. The destination stays private until a second
config-first transaction verifies its binding, ownership, bytes and current
governance and clears only the temporary lineage. A failed final write returns
the committed template with `warning: publish_incomplete`, matching legacy
publish behavior. Retrying the same name completes that transition, including
after restart or a lost response; changed source/target bytes, a newer binding
or foreign ownership refuse without overwriting anything. Completed receipts
remain for idempotent retries and never enter the shared agent JSON.

Native permission policies that exactly match
the existing allowedTools derivation follow owner approval edits. Custom
permission policies and alternate toolsSettings shortcuts require a separate
review and are refused rather than silently bypassed. Cleanup of superseded
private generations is not implemented by this backend checkpoint, and no
generation is deleted today. A future cleanup must retain every generation that
a member binding names, that a live session's `LoadedCapabilities` stamp names,
that a `CapabilityPreparation` returned by `prepare_runtime` still references
between preparation and the loaded stamp, that a persisted resume record could
lead back to, or that a retained publish receipt names as source or target.
Because a preparation exists before any stamp and holds no registry entry, the
three visible references (binding, stamp, receipt) do not prove a generation
unreferenced. Deletion therefore requires a shared lock or explicit allocation
lease taken by the reconciliation seam that mints generations, plus an audit of
persisted resume references, and it fails closed: a generation whose absence of
references cannot be proven is kept. Binding
updates preserve config.local member overrides and write a narrow delta in the
active layer under base-then-overlay locks. A batch spanning both layers uses
one atomic overlay delta. Enrollment preserves absent fields, null prompt/model
values, custom hooks/settings and the original includeMcpJson choice. Removing
capabilities while provider-global MCP inclusion remains enabled is refused as
unrepresentable; enrollment alone never silently disables that existing source.

Parent selection reuses `agent_spec_path` with an explicit scope directory.
Unrelated malformed files are skipped; duplicate names, a broken exact-name
project claim and a changed pinned source still refuse resolution. Safe response
projection retains arrays and maps and masks credential values. Complete sensitive
`NAME=VALUE` argument assignments are recognized on both sides of `--`; that
terminator stops option inference, not assignment scanning. Retention preserves
the entire original argument, including additional equals signs in its value. The
`agent_capabilities.py` response boundary is registered in the security posture
redaction inventory, so the omission gate checks it with the other outputs. MCP `set`
accepts `retain_paths`, RFC6901 pointers into the complete replacement value.
Each pointer must address exactly `[REDACTED]` and the same redacted scalar leaf
in the current member transport. Empty/root, malformed, overlapping, duplicate
and out-of-range pointers refuse the whole request; any unretained placeholder
also refuses. Omitted fields are removed, not deep-merged. Retained bytes stay
server-side and are covered by preview/revision checks. MCP rows carry an
explicit `managed` flag; absent prompt/model rows remain editable.

Owned Parents retain the existing dynamic command, hooks and data-home refresh.
That pass cannot add omitted servers or tools and preserves local prompt/model
and resource choices. App namespace transports require a current enabled app's
exact declaration and use its authoritative transport. Safe ordinary Parent
fields (description, welcomeMessage and keyboardShortcut) follow updates; legacy
snapshots retain their explicit local baseline for these fields.

Reconciliation publishes changed bytes under a new private name and atomically
switches the member binding, leaving the old runtime's file unchanged. A no-op
keeps its generation. Failed writes retain pending intent; retry completes it
without modifying an earlier generation. Already-published pending receipts can
finish without another generation. Public revisions are random version ids;
source-content digests remain internal. The prepare seam refuses pending work
and never reports provider application from a successful save. Enrollment
intent lives in the shared `agent_model_state.json`, so an unreadable sidecar
cannot prove any declared member unenrolled: `prepare_runtime` refuses every
crew-member cold start with the closed code `capability_state_unreadable` (the
capabilities API answers `503 capabilities_unavailable`) rather than inferring
legacy mode, and a session that resolves to no crew never reads the sidecar.
An explicit `crew_agent` claim naming no `config.agents` entry refuses with
`capability_member_missing`; an implicit name outside the crew namespace
resolves to no crew and is unaffected.

## Crew records and binding

A crew lives only in `config.json` under `agents.<name>`. It is not a kiro-cli
agent file: `kiro_agent` points at one. `resolve_agent_bindings` turns a crew
name into `ResolvedBindings`, in this order:

1. the named crew, when it is a key of `config.agents`;
2. otherwise a **materialized** kiro agent of that name (an app-registered agent
   under the user's `~/.kiro/agents/`, or a project agent), which keeps
   dispatching itself with the default workspace and Global Memory V1;
3. otherwise `default_agent`, with `requested_resolved` set to `False` so a
   caller never advertises a binding that is not running.

An unresolvable workspace falls back to `default_workspace`. Memory identity
resolves exactly: the reserved `default` assistant uses Global Memory V1;
existing members keep their declared V1 binding until the owner chooses V2.
New and opted-in members own unique private V2 stores. Missing, unreadable,
shared or mismatched private identity stops execution with an actionable error.
Selecting a member as `default_agent` preserves that member's memory version and
binding. With no agents configured, the resolver returns the existing defaults.

Member creation automatically provisions empty private memory. Members cannot
choose a shared store or rebind their private store. Legacy members may continue
using V1 or explicitly choose empty V2 memory from their settings; former Global
or named V1 contents remain untouched. Config fields, atomic publication, ownership manifest and
recovery semantics are owned by [config](config.md#named-memory-stores-memory_storespy).

A new member DM inherits the member's configured workspace, falling back to
`default_workspace` when that name is undeclared. Its project directory uses the
shared `default_project_dir` validation, so provider cwd and project essentials
refer to the same workspace. Resolution finishes before publishing the slot;
the first slot broadcast includes its project directory. A concurrent opener's
existing slot is preserved. Reopening a live or restored
thread keeps its saved workspace and project, including an explicitly empty
project, rather than resetting a session choice to the member default.

Opting into V2 opens a fresh member conversation. Existing V1 conversation and
native provider context cannot become private context by changing the config.
The member-thread binding records its private store generation and reuses that
conversation across later opens and restarts. An already protected V2 thread
keeps its existing key. Old schedules and child runs retain their recorded store;
the opt-in does not relabel past or already assigned work.

Private memory also pins an active dashboard turn to its member in ordinary
chat slots. A provider-side agent switch stops the stream with a visible notice
and resets the provider before another turn; later events cannot continue under
another agent while using that member's memory. This covers member DMs and
ordinary V2 chats. Ordinary V1 chats keep their existing switch behavior. The
validation and reset contract is owned by
[session](session.md#private-member-session-ownership).

The member side panel's Crew summary tab and the editor link to
`/settings/overview?view=memory&store=<name>`. The private memory workspace has
Memories, Profile and Recovery tabs: browsing/search/correction/copy stay in
Memories, preferences and project anchors stay in Profile, and backups plus
retired experiences stay in Recovery. Advanced facet analysis is collapsed.
Profile and Recovery load on first visit; visited Profile stays mounted so tab
changes cannot discard its drafts. Changing the selected member requires explicit
discard while a profile draft or memory mutation dialog is open. Source references
are rendered as origin labels and item references rather than JSON payloads.

The workspace header, store picker and copy-source picker reuse the owning
member's exact avatar descriptor and name, including uploaded pictures. Returning
from the member editor refreshes that identity. Empty memory can open
`/members?member=<exact-name>` directly; this link selects the member by name,
then uses the existing verified thread-opening endpoint. A failed thread open
retains its localized error heading and structured diagnostic report. Details
reveals the redacted reason on demand; Ask the agent receives the same report
when navigation permits. The cached conversation and its drafts remain available.

Facts, rules and experiences all support correction and explicit forgetting.
Experience correction keeps the same record identity and provenance. A store
marked unavailable still makes a scoped read to obtain its actual refusal, with
Retry and Recovery actions; it never displays cached records as a successful
read. Recovery paginates retired memories and refreshes live recall after an
item is restored. Complete snapshot restoration stays visibly staged across
page visits until gateway restart, and the owner can cancel the pending stage
without changing current memory or its saved backup.

Inline schedules created inside the editor persist `member_id` separately from
the provider template. A legacy schedule carrying only `agent_id` stays in Global
Memory V1 even when that string matches a member alias. The editor lists private
member jobs by exact `member_id`, and an existing job's member is immutable.
Legacy jobs retain their previous template/sequence display attribution and show
Global Memory V1 in the member's Schedules pane. Displaying an old schedule there
does not migrate it or grant access to that member's private store.

`resolve_effective_model` is the single source of truth for what model a new
session on a crew starts with, highest tier first: the crew's own `model`, the
bound kiro agent's pinned model (skipped for the built-in `kirocrew` agent), the
global `agent.model`, then the installed agent file's model. A per-session pick
outranks all four and is not considered there.

The loader is defensive about hand-edited config: a non-string `model` or
`triggers` collapses to `""`, an unknown `reasoning_effort` collapses to inherit,
and a junk watchdog override collapses to `0`.

## Selection: the `select_crew` contract

`select_crew` has two modes, both answered as JSON by `_do_select_crew`.

`route_crew` resolves each trigger-matched member independently. Healthy matches
retain their rank and owned store. Matching members whose memory cannot be
resolved appear in `unavailable` with a bounded, path- and credential-redacted
reason. No healthy match and no trigger match are distinct outcomes; unavailable
memory never authorizes substitution with Global memory. A named `select_crew`
refusal returns `crew` and `error` without a bound store or routing activity.

**Roster** (`crew` omitted or empty):

```json
{"default_agent": "default",
 "crews": [{"name": "oncall", "triggers": "incident, prod outage"}],
 "guidance": "Select a crew ONLY when its triggers clearly and specifically match…"}
```

Three rules define that list, and each is load-bearing:

- A crew whose `triggers` is empty or whitespace is **omitted entirely**. There
  is no fallback to `description`: no triggers means not a routing candidate.
- `default_agent` is omitted, because it is the caller.
- The response carries `default_agent` and `guidance` so the model has an
  explicit fallback and a high-confidence bar rather than inferring one.

**Bind** (`crew` names a roster entry):

```json
{"crew": "oncall",
 "bound": {"kiro_agent": "oncall-agent", "workspace": "/…/oncall",
           "memory_store": "oncall-mem", "model": ""}}
```

An unknown name answers `{"error": "unknown crew '…'", "available": "…"}`. The
membership test against `cfg.agents` is the deny-by-default gate;
`SELECT_CREW_SCHEMA` deliberately does not impose a name grammar, because crew
creation only strips the name, so a stricter schema would list a crew in the
roster and then refuse to bind it.

A bind also records a routing-decision pointer through
`members.record_activity` with `via="select_crew"`. Two properties of that write
matter:

- The entry keys the session under `decided_in`, not `session`, because the
  decision is made in the parent session while the crew runs somewhere else. A
  consumer counting sessions a crew took part in therefore cannot miscount a
  session the crew never ran in.
- The caller's memory mode is resolved at the call, and only `persistent`
  sessions are recorded. An unreadable session degrades to the private spelling,
  so the failure mode is a missing entry, never a durably logged private session
  key.

These entries are **intent, not execution**: binding a crew does not oblige the
model to delegate to it, and no `via="spawn"` execution entry exists today.

## Delegating to a bound crew

Explicit member delegation uses `spawn_run(crew=<member>)`. The member alias
resolves its provider template and private memory together. The separate
`agent=` argument identifies a provider template, not a durable member identity;
it must not be used to infer access to a member's private memory.

A private member's own sub-tasks and schedules retain its store. It cannot select
Global V1 or a peer through `spawn_run` or `cron_add`. The trusted owner or Crew
coordinator assigns cross-member work; named tool delegation respects the
recipient's routing opt-in. HTTP spawning verifies the actual calling process
before accepting a parent session, and the run primitive checks the boundary
again before allocating a provider.

A named-but-unknown agent is **refused**, never silently answered by the default
agent, with the machine-readable code `agent_not_found`. That refusal is a
privilege boundary: the default agent frequently runs at broader approval, so a
typo'd or injected name falling back to it would be an escalation at the manager
primitive. An empty `agent` still means "use the default".

Crew Mode resolves the alias itself instead of relying on the coincidence:
`CrewOrchestrator._dispatch_agent` calls `resolve_agent_bindings` per dispatch
and passes `bindings.kiro_agent`. It returns the raw crew name when
`requested_resolved` is `False`, so an unknown crew is refused by
`_validate_agent` rather than quietly running the default agent under a stale
name, and it resolves an empty crew too so the concrete template stays inside
`capabilities.spawn.scopes.agents`.

## Boundaries

- A crew's `triggers` is free text read by a model. It is not a matcher, and no
  regex interprets it.
- `POST /api/agents` requires an explicit `kiro_agent`; the silent `"kirocrew"`
  default is refused, because it made every template-less crew an alias for the
  default agent. A template absent from the installed listing is accepted with a
  warning rather than refused, since an edition may resolve a row the listing
  cannot see.
- A credential-shaped crew name is refused at creation, and roster values are
  masked for every caller but the owner. An already-stored name is not renamed
  retroactively, which is why the owner keeps reading it verbatim: a name must
  be legible to be renamed.
- `kirocrew`, `kirocrew-conductor`, `kirocrew-pipeline-conductor` and
  `kirocrew-security-conductor` are in `UNADVERTISED_AGENTS`, so they never
  appear in a rendered roster.

## Tests that pin this

| Test | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `test/test_select_crew.py` | Roster excludes the default crew and every triggerless crew, carries `default_agent` plus guidance; a named crew returns its bindings; an unknown name returns `error` plus `available`; the schema accepts spaces and dots in a crew name |
| `test/test_crew_reasoning_effort.py` | Per-crew effort reaches a crew dispatch |
| `test/test_members.py`, `test/test_members_dm_thread.py` | Slug validation and containment, activity recording and dedupe, DM-binding canonicality, rules and briefing reads |
| `test/test_chat_send_agent_model_default.py` | The crew model default a new session starts on |

## Retired: Crew Mode

Crew Mode was the `"crew"` chat-slot mode: one session whose messages became
durable queue entries, a single-flight decision agent that routed each to a
topic, and one continuable sub-session per topic, with results forwarded back
under `↩ re:` attribution. Its control plane lived in `crew_chat.py`; its
design of record is
[`../../request-for-change/rfc-orchestrator-chat-sessions.md`](../../request-for-change/rfc-orchestrator-chat-sessions.md).

It retired in favour of the Crew Members page, which inverts the model: instead
of one nameless session fanning out to topics, each crew is a named member with
its own standing thread. What remains, and why:

- **No ingress.** `"crew"` is in neither `_CREATABLE_MODES` (`chat_handlers`)
  nor `_VALID_MODES` (`chat_folders`) nor the fork override allowlist, so a
  session can no longer be born or switched into it. A caller still sending
  `mode: "crew"` on auto-create gets a plain slot (the value is dropped like any
  unknown mode); on the create and switch endpoints it is `invalid_mode`.
- **Existing sessions come back as plain chat.** `chat_persistence._restored_mode`
  maps a persisted `mode: "crew"` to `""` on both restore paths. The transcript
  is untouched and still renders; nothing is migrated and nothing is deleted.
  The store the mode kept under `<data home>/crew/<folded key>-<digest>/`
  (`queue.json`, `topics.json`, `forwards.json`, `slot_key`) held only routing
  state — it is neither read nor removed, and a reader who wants the disk back
  may delete that directory by hand.
- **Old transcripts keep their shape.** The frontend's `TurnBlock.isCrewReply`
  still honours the persisted `meta.crew_reply` marker so a forwarded topic
  answer in an old session renders outside the collapse pane, as it did when it
  was written. Nothing writes the marker any more.
- **The autonudge crew/member boundary keeps its vocabulary.** `autonudge_authz`
  still lists `"crew"` beside `"member"` in the modes that refuse an outside
  arm. With no slot able to carry the mode the entry is unreachable, and it is
  left in place rather than re-litigating a security boundary in a removal PR.

The sidebar's create-menu entry that used to create a crew-mode session is now
a "Crew Members" door: it opens `/members` when `PREVIEW_CREW` (Settings →
Developer → Feature Previews) is on and lands on that flag's card when it is
off.
