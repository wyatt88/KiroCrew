// Per-chunk bundle-size regression gate.
//
// Usage:
//   vite build --mode analyze && node scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs
//   node scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs [path/to/bundle-report.json]
//
// The global `chunkSizeWarningLimit` in vite.config.ts is one ceiling for every
// chunk, sized to the largest known-large chunk -- so it cannot tell
// "known-large" from "newly oversized": any NEW chunk up to that ceiling is
// admitted silently. This gate closes that gap with explicit per-chunk budgets:
// the chunks that are irreducibly large today are allowlisted at ceilings just
// above their measured size, and every other chunk gets a 500 KB default. A
// chunk over its budget fails the build with one actionable line per breach.
//
// Reads the `dist/bundle-report.json` that the `kirocrew-bundle-report` plugin
// emits in analyze mode (see vite.config.ts), so a normal `npm run build` stays
// byte-for-byte unaffected -- CI runs the analyze build and then this script.

  // `App` entries below: a ceiling that drifted to <1% headroom fails on
  // routine string growth rather than on the new library it exists to catch.
  // Re-measured 2026-09-10: main @ b165ba1be alone builds the chunk at
  // 11,302,007 B (11037 KB) against the 10975 KB ceiling -- 62 KB OVER, so
  // main's own gate is red and every PR rebased onto it inherits the failure.
  // Attribution is measured, not assumed: the two feature PRs merged back to
  // back at 17:53-17:54 (#9810 browser element annotations, +423 catalog lines
  // across 13 languages; #9812 file-viewer type-first annotator, +107 lines)

  // library, reached the runtime module.
  // Re-measured 2026-09-04 at 740 KB, and the 702 KB note above was ~38 KB
  // stale, which is the same recurrence it describes: main drifted to EXACTLY
  // 740.00 KB (757,764 B, 4 B over its own ceiling), so the gate began failing
  // on the merge ref of every open PR rather than on the new library or surface
  // it exists to catch. Attribution was measured, not assumed -- the branch that
  // tripped it first builds a BYTE-IDENTICAL `t` chunk to its own base
  // (`t-BLZeayKy.js`, 755,868 B on both), and main's tip alone, with none of that
  // branch's code, reproduces the 4-byte failure with the same content hash. So
  // the growth is main's accumulated English strings, and headroom is what was
  // actually missing. 5% headroom, matching the `all` entry's convention above,
  // so the next English string does not re-trip this for the third time.
  // Re-measured 2026-09-08: main @ 9af9543b0 alone builds the chunk at
  // 795,127 B (776.5 KB) against the 777 KB ceiling -- 0.07% headroom, the
  // same drift again (~36 KB of English strings in four days). A feature PR
  // adding ~40 keys (#8307) trips it on its merge ref while main's own gate
  // stays green, so the ceiling moves back to the 5% convention.
  // Two catalog surfaces stack on this chunk after the merge: the

  // merged analyze build measures the chunk at 807,525 B (788.6 KB); keep

  // combined measurement so expected catalog growth does not block descendants.

  // growth is English catalog copy only: the feature's 96 keys
  // (`crewCapabilities` / `crewCapabilityEditing`, ~4.7 KB) plus 15 upstream
  // keys that landed on main after the branch's previous rebase. The chunk
  // report counts 12 modules; this PR adds no dependency. This is the
