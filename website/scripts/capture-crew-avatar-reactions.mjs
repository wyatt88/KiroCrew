 * Self-checking before every frame, because a reaction that silently resolved to
 * the resting face photographs as a correct-looking ghost. The states scene must
 * render four DISTINCT faces AND carry the keyframes of each chosen motion in the
 * composed markup; the builder scene must be on the Reactions tab with all three
 * state rows, and its two motion selects must show the picks the record stores. A
 * screenshot of the wrong state is worse evidence than none.
