//
// Always-on capture of the app's NATIVE diagnostic output (Chromium + V8 +
// renderer), so a crash explains itself without the user having relaunched
// under a debugger first.
//
// The problem this solves: everything Chromium and V8 print goes to the
// process's raw stderr, and a GUI launch (Dock, Finder, Start menu) discards
// stderr entirely. It is not in the macOS unified log either — verified against
// a real renderer abort: `log show --last 12h` filtered to the Electron
// framework returned zero fatal lines. So the single most useful sentence about
// a renderer death — V8's own `Fatal error in ... / Reached heap limit /
// invalid size` — was being thrown away, leaving only a `.ips` crash report
// whose `asi` field is null and whose every frame symbol is a
// nearest-neighbour mismatch. `renderer-recovery.js` could say THAT the
// renderer died and reload it; nothing could say WHY.
//
// This is the same correction already applied to the gateway child process,
// whose spawn used `stdio:"ignore"` until a silent Gatekeeper SIGKILL proved
// that a discarded stream is a discarded bug report (see the comment above
// `gatewayLogPath` in main.js). The app's own native output is the last stream
// still going nowhere.
//
// Two channels, because they carry different things and neither subsumes the
// other:
//
//   1. Chromium's log file (`--enable-logging=file --log-file=`). Carries
//      Chromium's own `LOG()` output, renderer console errors, and GPU /
//      network / sandbox failures. Set from here rather than asked of the user,
//      because a switch the user must remember to pass is a switch that is
//      never set on the launch that actually crashed.
//   2. A local minidump via `crashReporter`. Carries the abort context for a
//      renderer that dies without printing anything at all.
//
// Both are bounded by keeping exactly two generations of the log file (see
// `rotateNativeLog`): the run being debugged is almost never the run that is
// running, so the previous session has to survive the relaunch that
// investigates it.
//
// Deliberately NOT attempted: redirecting the main process's own fd 2 to a
// file. Node exposes no `dup2`, so the only ways to do it are a native addon or
// re-spawning the app with `stdio` set — a double launch that would break the
// single-instance lock, Dock activation, and the updater. A terminal launch
// (`Contents/MacOS/<name> > log 2>&1`) remains the way to capture true raw
// stderr, and that stays a deliberate debugging step rather than something the
// app does to itself on every boot.
//
// Pure logic + injected dependencies: Electron main is not exercised by the
// unit test runner, so the decisions have to be testable without a live `app`
// (same pattern as renderer-recovery.js / perf-metrics.js).

 * Start-of-boot rotation, which is what bounds this file's size.
 *
 * Neither Chromium's log file nor this app's `glog` has any rotation (glog is a
 * bare appendFileSync), so an always-on stream that only ever appends would
 * grow without limit on a long-lived install. But truncating to nothing is the
 * opposite mistake: it destroys the previous session at the exact moment a
 * developer relaunches to investigate it. A main-process crash, a hard quit, or
 * simply "change the code and restart to reproduce" all end the session that
 * holds the evidence, and the next launch would wipe it before anyone read it.
 * (Only a RENDERER death is healed in-process, and that is the narrow case —
 * not the general one this capture exists for.)
 *
 * So: keep one generation. The current file becomes `chromium.previous.log` and
 * Chromium creates a fresh one, leaving the last bad run readable from inside
 * the run that is debugging it. Renaming rather than copying also means this
 * works whether Chromium opens its log in append or truncate mode — the path it
 * opens is simply absent, so it starts clean either way.
 *
 * The bound is therefore two sessions. A single session is not itself capped,
 * because Chromium owns that file handle and nothing on this side can cap it;
 * the size that matters in practice is one session's worth of Chromium logging,
 * which is small unless something is looping — and something looping is the
 * thing we want recorded.
 *
 * Returns which generations exist afterwards. A failure is reported, never
 * thrown: losing rotation is worth a log line, not a failed launch.
