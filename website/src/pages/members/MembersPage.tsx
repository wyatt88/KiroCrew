/**
 * Crew Members — one durable, pinned DM thread per crew member.
 *
 * CAPTURED: Settings > Developer > Feature Previews shows a screenshot of this
 * page in its "See what it looks like" dialog. A visible change here makes that
 * picture stale — re-shoot with `scripts/capture-feature-previews.mjs`.
 *
 * The page realizes the B+C merged design: a member list on the left, the
 * selected member's pinned DM thread in the center (the real chat stack,
 * hosted the way split-view panes host it), and on the right the SAME tabbed
 * side panel the chat page docks — permanent, no close control — whose first
 * tab is the member's Crew summary (read-only observation) and whose + menu
 * offers the chat panel's own views (Files, Artifacts, Terminal, Browser…)
 * against the member's DM slot, because a member thread IS a chat slot.
 * Configuration WRITES are deliberately absent — both Edit affordances
 * navigate to the existing crew manager (/capabilities?tab=crews), so this
 * page never becomes a second editor.
 *
 * Identity is the exact CREW NAME, never the slug: slugification is lossy
 * (`Oncall` and `oncall` share a slug and therefore one thread directory),
 * so rows are keyed and selected by name, and a thread-open response whose
 * `member` is a DIFFERENT name is surfaced as a collision instead of being
 * silently mounted (first-bound-wins is the backend contract).
 *
 * The pin is a server-side property of member slots (born only through
 * POST /api/members/{slug}/thread). It is an invariant of every member
 * thread, so the UI does not announce it — there is no unpinned state to
 * contrast against.
 *
 * Which member is open rides the URL (`?member=<name>`), and the last one
 * opened is remembered per browser: a visit that names no member lands on
 * the remembered one (else the first row), never on the empty column.
