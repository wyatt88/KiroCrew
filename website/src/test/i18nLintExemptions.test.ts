/**
 * The exemptions in `eslint.i18n.config.js`, asserted through the real lint.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `eslint-plugin-i18next` compiles every `words.exclude` entry with
 * `generateFullMatchRegExp`, which appends `$` unless the source already ends in
 * one. A pattern written as a PREFIX therefore matches only itself:
 *
 *   `^https?://`  ->  /^^https?:\/\/$/    matched only the bare scheme
 *   `^[.~]?/`     ->  /^^[.~]?\/$/        matched only `/`, `./`, `~/`
 *
 * Both shipped like that and exempted nothing. Nothing failed, because the URL /
 * path class was silently carried by the lowercase-token pattern instead — whose
 * character class holds no `*`, `?`, `_`, `=`, `&` or capital. So `/api/chat/*`
 * was reported as untranslated user copy while `/api/chat` on the line above was
 * not, and the difference was one character nobody could see in the config.
 *
 * That failure mode is invisible in two directions at once: existing code is
 * frozen in the ledgers (and both whole-repo ledger checks are report-only), and
 * the diff-scoped gates fail only lines a branch WROTE. So the authors who could
 * have noticed never saw it, and the authors who hit it had no way to tell a
 * config bug from a real finding.
 *
 * These tests lint real source text with the real config, so they fail if a
 * pattern stops matching what it claims to — including after a dependency bump
 * that changes how patterns are compiled.

/**
 * Whether `pattern` is genuinely end-anchored once the plugin compiles it.
 *
 * A raw `endsWith('$')` is not enough, and the gap is exactly the class this
 * guard exists to catch: `'^Price: \\$'` ends in `$` as source text, but that `$`
 * is ESCAPED, so `generateFullMatchRegExp` sees a terminal `$` and appends
 * nothing — leaving `/^^Price: \$/`, which matches `'Price: $5 Save changes'`.
 * That is a bare-prefix pattern smuggled past the check.
 *
 * Three ways a pattern can be end-unanchored, all of them checked:
 *
 *   1. no trailing `$` at all — the original bug;
 *   2. a trailing `$` that is escaped — count the backslashes before it, an even
 *      number (including none) leaves it an anchor, an odd number escapes it;
 *   3. a TOP-LEVEL alternation — `'^X|.*$'` ends in an unescaped `$`, yet only
 *      its second branch is anchored and that branch matches every string. A `|`
 *      inside a group or a character class is fine (`^(Ctrl|Alt)$`), so depth has
 *      to be tracked rather than the character merely searched for.
 *
 * A `RegExp` entry is checked the same way via its `source`: the plugin returns a
 * `RegExp` untouched, so one written as a bare prefix is unanchored exactly as
 * written.
