/**
 * Release-channel worktree rows in the Dev Fleet table.
 *
 * The whole feature is a claim about WHICH RELEASE a checkout is sitting on, so
 * every test here asserts on what the row states rather than on whether it
 * rendered. Two failure modes are specifically guarded:
 *
 * - **Adopting on the name.** `release-channel-stable` is a reserved basename. A
 *   user's own branch checkout under that name must keep ordinary controls; only
 *   the backend's `worktree` field (set when the tree is detached at a resolved
 *   ref) confers lane controls.
 * - **Reusing a column with a different meaning silently.** BEHIND counts from
 *   the LANE TIP on these rows, not from main, and PR is inapplicable rather
 *   than merely absent.
