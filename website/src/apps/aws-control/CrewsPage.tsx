/**
 * AWS Control - the remote crews pane.
 *
 * A remote crew is a Kiro Crew gateway the owner deployed into their OWN AWS
 * account as a service their customers reach: one CloudFormation stack per crew,
 * one ECS service inside it, behind the shared load balancer the base stack owns.
 * This pane answers what exists and lets the owner open one. It creates nothing.
 *
 * THE NAME IS OVERLOADED and the copy here is what keeps it apart. On the Agents
 * page a "crew" is a LOCAL agent and its card component is literally called
 * `CrewCard`. Ours are remote and run on someone else's machine, in the cloud, for
 * other people. The rail says "Crews" (the reader is inside the AWS app, so the
 * short word is unambiguous there) and every surface below says "remote crews",
 * with a blurb that names the other kind explicitly rather than trusting the
 * adjective to carry it.
 *
 * The detail view is VIEW STATE in this pane, not a route: `BuiltinAppRoute`
 * resolves only single-segment routes, which is the same reason the drive page is
 * view state inside `AwsControlPage`. A breadcrumb returns.
 *
 * The card shape follows the Agents page's `CrewCard`: a fixed-height header
 * block, then a 2x2 grid of labelled facts under a divider. Same shape, this
 * pane's own four facts - the same relationship `DrivePage` has with
 * `LibraryTable`'s header chrome. The header height is fixed for the reason that
 * card documents: a badge is taller than plain text, so a card carrying one would
 * push its fact grid below its neighbour's and the row would read as ragged. The
 * NUMBER differs (38px, not 54px) because that card reserves two description
 * lines and a remote crew has no description field in the wire shape - here the
 * block holds one name line plus one identity line.

 * What to show for `image` on a CARD: the digest, short.

 * path and 64 hex characters - over a hundred, with the part that identifies the

 * `111122223333.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/…`: a label with no fact under
 * it, which is the same defect as showing the same stack name on every card.
 *
 * So the card renders the digest and the DETAIL renders the whole URI with a copy
 * button. This is a rendering of `image`, not a new field computed from it: no
 * value is invented, and the full one is a click away and on hover. A value
 * without a digest is shown whole, because `crews.py` returns the stack parameter
 * verbatim and this UI does not get to assume what an older stack put there.
 *
 * The `sha256:` prefix is dropped along with the registry: the template's pattern
 * makes it the same on every crew that can exist, so it spends a third of the
