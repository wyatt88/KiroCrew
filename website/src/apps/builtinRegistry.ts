/**
 * Register additional builtin route → component mappings at runtime.
 *
 * This is the extension seam for a downstream edition that bundles its own
 * builtin pages: instead of editing (and re-diffing) this file on every upstream
 * sync, the edition calls this once from the extensions.ts composition root
 * (loaded before App mounts; routes resolve lazily on navigation, so this
 * registry does not need to be reactive). Existing entries are never
 * overwritten silently — a duplicate route is a no-op and logs a warning, so
 * the core's own registrations always win.
 *
 * A route must be a single, plain top-level path segment: `BuiltinAppRoute`
 * resolves the catch-all `/:builtinApp` from ONE path parameter, and only the
 * `location.pathname` — never the query or hash — is matched against the
 * registry. So anything that isn't a bare segment would register but never
 * resolve: `/reports/daily` (extra segment → matches `/reports`),
 * `/reports?daily` or `/reports#x` (the `?daily`/`#x` isn't in the pathname →
 * matches `/reports`), or whitespace/`.`/`..`. All redirect to chat — the
 * silent-vanish failure the seams guard against. The pattern therefore requires
 * a leading alphanumeric then only URL-path-safe chars (`A-Za-z0-9._~-`) and NO
 * second `/`, `?`, `#`, or whitespace; `.`/`..` are excluded by the mandatory
 * alphanumeric first char. A non-conforming route routes through
 * `reportSeamCollision` (fail-loud dev/test, warn-and-ignore prod), same as a
 * duplicate.
