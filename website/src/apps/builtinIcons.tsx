/**
 * Builtin App Nav-Icon Registry
 *
 * Maps an app manifest's `ui.icon` name (a string) to the rendered Lucide
 * element shown in the left-nav rail for builtin apps. Lifting this out of
 * App.tsx makes it an extension seam: a downstream edition that bundles its
 * own builtin apps registers their icons via `registerBuiltinIcons()` from its
 * entry module instead of editing App.tsx on every upstream sync.
 *
 * App.tsx reads it through `getBuiltinIcon(name)`, so adding an app's icon
 * never requires touching App.tsx.
 *
 * Scope: registration is expected at module-load time (edition composition),
 * before App mounts — this registry is not reactive, so registering after the
 * nav has rendered will not appear until the next unrelated re-render.
