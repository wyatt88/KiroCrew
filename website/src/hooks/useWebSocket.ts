   *  This is a two-way reconcile rather than an add-only sync for that reason.

   *     blocked until timeout. Only ids present before the fetch can be dropped,
   *     and Redux state is immutable, so the pre-fetch reference cannot contain
   *     a later addition.
   *   - a `question_card_resolved` arriving during the fetch leaves a card in the
   *     response that is already dead; re-adding it would resurrect a card whose
   *     submit can only 404. Those ids are skipped on the add side.

   *  read every time (a cached answer is the thing being corrected, so it must
   *  never be served from cache), and the key is deliberately NOT the Workflows
