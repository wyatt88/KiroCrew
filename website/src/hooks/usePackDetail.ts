/**
 * One appearance pack's detail, read through React Query.
 *
 * Query key: `['appearance-pack', id]`.
 *
 * The detail route inlines every file in the pack, so the budget is one read per
 * pack per session however many avatars wear it — React Query's in-flight
 * sharing and `staleTime: Infinity` give exactly that. Retry is the shared
 * client's policy (`api/queryClient.ts`: one retry with backoff, a longer ladder
 * on 429 throttles, none on a deadline we set) rather than a per-hook number, so
 * a pack read behaves like every other dashboard read when the gateway is
 * throttled or down. A query left in error state has no data, so React Query
 * refetches it on the next mount, window focus or reconnect, which is how an
 * avatar recovers once the gateway is back.
 *
 * Invalidating the key notifies every mounted subscriber, so a pack re-imported
 * under the same id redraws on every roster row that wears it, not only on the
 * Library tab that did the importing.
