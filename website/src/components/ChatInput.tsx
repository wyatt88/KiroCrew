             the release while this panel outlives it: `showDictation` is gated
             on `voiceRecording`, which stays true through the streaming drain.
             `bar === 'settling'` can only name the gesture's OWN drain (the
             hook records `draining` solely on its own commit path), so the
             keyboard hint stays suppressed for exactly the drain the finger
             just committed — and stays SHOWN for a keyboard-binding capture,
             where Esc/Enter genuinely work. */

                previously dead weight — an empty composer on a slot whose last
                turn was cut off. Pressing it hands the thread back to the agent
                instead of sending nothing. The moment the user types a character
                the arrow and the send action come back, so the control never
                carries two meanings at once.

                Labeled, not an icon: this is the only control in the row whose
                action a first-time user cannot infer from its glyph. A bare ▶
                reads as "resume paused media", which is the wrong model — the
                agent is not paused, it is being asked for another turn — and an
                icon-only button puts that correction in a tooltip, which does
                not exist on touch. The word carries it instead, and RotateCw
                replaces Play so the glyph stops promising playback. Widening to
                a pill is deliberate: at 32px round it was pixel-identical to
                Send, so the two most consequential buttons in the composer
                differed only by the symbol inside them.

                The visible text is also the accessible name — no aria-label,
                which would override the label a sighted user reads and break
                WCAG 2.5.3 (Label in Name). `title` carries the longer
                explanation for hover.
