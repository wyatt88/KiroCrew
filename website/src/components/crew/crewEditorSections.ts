/**
 * The crew editor's section registry — the single list the rail, its badges and
 * the overview diagram all render from.
 *
 * Why a registry rather than a hand-written rail: a crew accumulates surfaces
 * (skills, tools, permissions, an activity log) faster than a stacked-section
 * dialog can absorb them, and each one arriving as fresh JSX is how the previous
 * layout reached four prose sections for five controls. Adding a surface here is
 * one entry plus one pane; nothing about the shell is edited.
 *
 * The groups are phrased as questions about the crew rather than as
 * configuration nouns ("Runtime binding"). That is not decoration: a
 * config-shaped grouping has no slot for "what is it allowed to do" or "what has
 * it done", so those surfaces would have had to invent a group each, and the
 * rail's meaning would drift with every addition.
 *
 * Built inside a hook, never as a module constant: a module-level array of
 * translated labels is evaluated at import time and freezes whichever language
 * was active then, which is why `scripts/i18n-codemod.mjs` refuses to convert
 * one.
