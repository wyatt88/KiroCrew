 * need marks even under NFC), underscore, dot, dash, @, ~, colon, space and
 * PARENTHESES, separated by slashes — EITHER kind, because a Windows gateway
 * names its files with `\`. Anchored at both ends, so anything carrying a URL
 * scheme (`https://…`) or shell punctuation fails outright.
 *
 * The punctuation set is a DECIDED boundary, not an accumulation. Two review
 * rounds each found one more character that is legal in a real filename —
 * parentheses (`C:\Program Files (x86)`, the most-trodden directory on Windows)
 * and then an apostrophe (`C:\Users\O'Neil`) — which is the signature of an
 * allowlist being discovered one bug report at a time. So the rule is stated once
 * instead: admit every character that is legal in a filename on BOTH platforms
 * and is not a shell control operator, on both shapes, since the two describe one
 * filesystem convention and an asymmetry is only a later bug report.
 *
 * IN: letters, marks, digits, `_ . @ ~ - space` and `' ! # % = + , ( ) [ ] { }`.
 * A closing bracket may also END a path, so `App (old)` and `data [2026]`
 * classify as directories.
 *
 * OUT, deliberately — these are what keep the anchored shape from matching a
 * command or a URL: `$` and a backtick (expansion), `&` `;` `|` (chaining),
 * `<` `>` (redirection), `"` (quoting), `?` `*` (globbing), and `:` anywhere but
 * the last segment, where it serves `file:447`. Windows forbids `< > : " / \ | ?
 * *` in a filename outright, so excluding them costs nothing there and buys the
 * prose rejection everywhere.
 *
 * Widening the repertoire never widens the positive-signal rule, so punctuated
 * prose (`foo/bar (baz)`, `a&&b/c.sh`) still carries neither a root nor an
 * extension and is still refused below.
 *
 * Admitting `\` as a separator here is what lets a relative Windows path
 * (`src\main.py`, `.\src\main.py`) reach the probe. It cannot express a
 * DRIVE-rooted path, whose colon sits before the first separator while this

 *
 * Cost on POSIX is nil: `//tmp/x` names the same file as `/tmp/x`, which is

 * decides whether spending a stat probe is worthwhile. The probe
 * (`usePathKind`) makes the actual call.
 *
 * Merely containing a slash is not enough: that matched git refs
 * (`refs/heads/…`, `origin/main`), repo slugs (`owner/repo`), MIME types
 * (`text/plain`), npm scopes (`@scope/pkg`) and dates (`2026/08/02`), every one
 * of which then rendered as a clickable "file" that could only ever 404. So a
 * candidate must carry a positive signal that it names a location:
 *
 *   - rooted — POSIX (`/x`, `~/x`) or a Windows drive (`C:\x`, `C:/x`), or
 *   - explicitly relative (`./x`, `../x`, `.\x`, `..\x`), or
 *   - a file extension on the last segment (`src/main.py`, `src\main.py`).
 *
 * A bare two-segment identifier with no extension is rejected. That rejection is
 * what keeps the backslash separator safe on every platform: a `\`-joined
 * non-path carries no extension, so an escape sequence (`\n`), a registry key
 * (`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Foo`) and a domain-qualified login
 * (`CORP\alice`) all still fail here rather than becoming a chip that could only
 * 404. Note the third rule still admits `origin/feature/x.ts`; that is
 * intentional — syntax cannot settle it, and the stat probe will.
 *
 * UNC is refused FIRST, ahead of every shape and signal test, because the other
 * rules would otherwise readmit it: the extension rule matches
 * `\\host\share\x.txt`, and the leading-`/` rule matches `//host/share/x`.
 * See `UNC_PREFIX_RE` for why that shape must never reach the probe.
 *
 * A directory written with a trailing separator (`/home/user/notes/`,
 * `C:\Users\me\`) is classified by retrying on the slash-stripped form when the
 * literal string fails: `PATH_SHAPE_RE` requires the string to END in a name
 * character, so a trailing `/` otherwise fails the shape and the directory chip
 * renders dead -- the directory-chip half of issue #9409. This widens NOTHING.
 * The retry runs the SAME rules on the string minus one trailing separator, so a
 * trailing slash rescues only a string whose slash-less form is already a
 * candidate: `owner/repo/`, `text/plain/` and `2026/08/02/` stay rejected because
 * `owner/repo` etc. are. The literal form is tried first so a bare drive root
 * (`C:\`, whose slash-stripped `C:` is not a valid shape) keeps classifying, and
 * the UNC refusal runs on the ORIGINAL string so `//host/share/` cannot slip
 * through the strip.

 *  Selecting a rendered table by hand and pasting it produces tab-separated
 *  cells at best and a run of words at worst, so the copy has to be offered.

 *  for a doc, an issue, or another chat, and CSV for a spreadsheet. Both are

 *  from the DOM -- see `tableClipboard.ts` for why (alignment is not forwarded
 *  to the DOM, and inline-code chips carry UI a text walk cannot tell apart
 *  from content).
 *
 *  The row follows the code block's pattern exactly: hidden until the table is
 *  hovered or focused (`group-hover` / `group-focus-within`), and always shown
 *  on a hover-less (touch) device through `HOVER_NONE_ACTIONS_ROW_CLS`, so it
 *  is discoverable there without adding permanent chrome under every table on
 *  a desktop. It sits BELOW the table, not over the header cells, so it never
 *  covers a column label. Each button carries a short visible verb label
 *  beside its glyph ("Copy Markdown", "Copy CSV") -- a touch screen shows no
 *  tooltip, so the word alone must say what a tap does; it flips to "Copied!"
 *  on success so the confirmation reads as text, not only as a colour.
 *
 *  The horizontal-scroll wrapper and the table's own class contract are
 *  unchanged (`MarkdownRenderer.tableWrap.test.tsx` pins them): the wrapper
 *  still owns `overflow-x-auto`, and this component only adds a sibling row
 *  after it. */

// ── CJK autolink boundaries ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// GFM's autolink-literal extension ends a bare `https://…` run only at ASCII
// whitespace or `<`. CJK punctuation written directly after a URL — the way
// Chinese and Japanese prose actually writes it, with no space — is therefore
// swallowed INTO the href:
//
//   （https://example.com/pull/1，`abc`）：`ready`
//   -> href="https://example.com/pull/1%EF%BC%8C%60abc%60…"
//
// The wrong href is the smaller half of the damage. The run also eats the
// OPENING backtick of the code span that follows, which shifts every later
// backtick pairing in the paragraph by one: prose renders as inline code and
// real code renders with literal backticks. One missing space corrupts the
// rest of the message.
//
// The same swallow takes the CLOSING `**` of a bold-wrapped URL, the shape
// `**https://…**（revision 1）` that CJK prose writes with no space between the
// emphasis and the punctuation after it. GFM trims a TRAILING `*`, so this only
// breaks when a non-space follows: the `**` stops being a delimiter, the opening
// `**` renders as two literal asterisks, and every later `**` in the paragraph
// re-pairs against the wrong partner.
//
// This has to be fixed at the SOURCE level, not on the mdast: re-splitting the
// link node after the fact cannot restore the code-span pairing, because the
// pairing is decided while micromark tokenizes the whole paragraph. So force
// the boundary before parsing by re-emitting the URL head as an angle autolink
// `<url>`, which has an explicit end and renders identically.
//
// The cut is EVIDENCE-BASED, not character-based — see cjkCutIndex and
// strongDelimCutIndex. CJK punctuation reaches real URLs raw
// (`…/wiki/苹果（公司）`), so cutting on the character alone would break links
// that render correctly today.
//
// Which regions are off-limits is read off remark's OWN parse (see
// autolinkLiteralSpans) rather than a hand-rolled scanner: only a real GFM
// autolink-literal node is ever touched, so code, existing links, raw HTML and
// math are excluded by construction instead of by a mask that has to re-derive
// every CommonMark block and inline rule correctly.
//
// Scope: only `http(s)://` runs. Scheme-less `www.` literals have the same flaw
// but cannot be closed with `<…>` (angle autolinks require a scheme).

// Punctuation classes. CJK punctuation is NOT by itself proof that a URL ended:
// real page titles contain it, and they reach the URL raw —
// `https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/苹果（公司）`, `https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/我，机器人`,
// `https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/モーニング娘。`. Cutting on the character alone

 * writes — a delimiter PAIR wrapping the URL, whose closing half GFM has
 * swallowed into the href. Leaving it there costs the emphasis its delimiter, so
 * the opener degrades to two literal asterisks and every later `**` in the
 * paragraph re-pairs against the wrong partner.
 *
 * BOTH ends must be real, and both are judged against the text the author wrote:
 * the prefix must leave an opener open (hasPendingStrongOpener) AND the candidate
 * inside the run must itself be a legitimate closer. Checking only the opener is
 * not enough — `__See https://example.com/a__b for details__` opens a real `__`
 * and then hits an INTRAWORD `__` in the path, which closes nothing, so cutting
 * there truncates a correct link and the emphasis stays open anyway.
 *
 * The candidate must also be followed by CJK PUNCTUATION — the same class the two
 * rules above already act on. Flanking cannot carry this: in `?q=foo**-bar` the
 * `**` has a word character before it and punctuation after it, which is exactly
 * the shape of a real closer before punctuation, and a candidate followed by a
 * fullwidth mark is right-flanking by construction (a run holds no whitespace, and
 * the mark itself is punctuation), so a closer check on it can never refuse
 * anything. The requirement is deliberately narrower than "any non-ASCII": an
 * ideograph is legal mid-path (`?q=a**中文`), so treating one as a boundary would
 * truncate a working URL.
 *
 * Consequences worth knowing, both accepted:
 *  - An all-ASCII paragraph is never cut, and neither is `**url**已合并` (an
 *    ideograph, not punctuation, follows the delimiter). This pass carries `Cjk` in
 *    its name; the shape it is for is `**url**（…` / `**url**，…`.
 *  - A URL whose path genuinely carries a fullwidth mark straight after a `**`
 *    (`…/wiki/苹果**（公司）`) would be cut short. That is the SAME residual risk
 *    rules 1 and 2 already accept, on the same character class.
 *
 * A trailing delimiter never reaches here: GFM trims a trailing `*`/`_` off the
 * autolink literal, so `**https://x.com/a**` — which renders correctly today —
 * yields a node whose source stops at `a`, with no delimiter inside the run.

/**
 * A `[text](https?://…?…)` span whose destination carries RAW spaces or tabs.
 *
 * CommonMark refuses whitespace inside an unbracketed link destination, so the
 * whole span fails to parse as a link: the label renders as literal
 * `[text](`-prefixed prose and GFM autolinks just the head of the URL — the
 * href truncates at the first space (in practice the first unencoded query
 * param value), which is how an agent-emitted pre-filled URL becomes
 * unclickable.
 *
 * Three deliberate bounds, each the conservative direction:
 *  - The head must carry a `?`, and the run's LAST chunk must contain a
 *    `&name=` param start (see QUERY_CONTINUATION_RE below). An unencoded
 *    QUERY STRING is the shape this pass exists for, and only a new param
 *    opening in the final chunk proves the query spans every space to the
 *    run's end. Without that proof — `[docs](https://x.com/a for the full
 *    list)`, or `…?ref=1 for the full list` — the tail is PROSE after a
 *    truncated link, and absorbing it into the href would delete visible
 *    words and mint a dead URL, worse than the truncation it replaces. The
 *    cost is that a spaced value in a SINGLE-param URL (`?title=a b`) is not
 *    rescued: with no second param there is no evidence, and the issue's
 *    reported shape carries several `&`-separated params.
 *  - The label admits no brackets (`[^\][\n]`). A label that fails to close
 *    makes every later `[` restart the scan over the same characters, which
 *    is quadratic on `[`-heavy input — and a streaming message re-runs this
 *    on every reparse. Excluding `[` makes each start position fail in O(1),
 *    so the scan is linear; a nested-bracket label was never rescued before
 *    and still is not.
 *  - The chunks are `[^\s()]+`: a `(` or `)` inside the destination is
 *    CommonMark's OTHER refusal (unbalanced parens), where the span's true
 *    extent is genuinely ambiguous, so those spans are left alone.
 *
 * An uppercase scheme (`HTTPS://…`) is NOT rescued, and deliberately so: GFM
 * autolinks the uppercase head (schemes are case-insensitive there), and the
 * parse gate below sees that node as non-prose and skips the span. Reaching
 * it would mean loosening the gate that protects every accepted span, for a
 * casing agents do not emit.

 * While STREAMING, withhold an incomplete trailing table so it never paints as

 *
 * remark-gfm needs BOTH a header row and a `|---|` delimiter row to recognize a
 * table. Mid-stream the header arrives first and renders as a <p> containing
 * literal "| A | B |"; when the delimiter row streams in, that paragraph
 * RESTRUCTURES into a bordered table — a visible structural snap of
 * already-shown content (see MarkdownRenderer.streamingTableSnap.test.tsx).
 * This defers the trailing header run (mirroring how an incomplete fenced code
 * block is held) until the delimiter arrives, so the transition the user sees
 * is the standard "content appears", not "paragraph morphs into a table".
 *
 * Scoped narrowly to avoid hiding ordinary prose: only a run of trailing
 * non-blank lines whose FIRST line is a bordered table header (starts with `|`)
 * is a candidate, and only when that run does NOT yet contain a delimiter row
 * (a `---` row that actually carries a `|`). A run that already has such a
 * delimiter is a real (possibly still growing) table and is left to render.
 *
 * Scoping choices (both close known edge cases):
 *  - Require the first line to START with `|`. A looser "≥2 pipes" test also
 *    matched ordinary prose (e.g. a line with an inline `` `cmd | grep | wc` ``)
 *    and would withhold that whole paragraph for the rest of the stream. Models
 *    emit bordered tables (`| a | b |`), so start-with-`|` keeps the real case
 *    while excluding prose; a borderless table simply isn't deferred (it never
 *    regressed anything — it just renders as before).
 *  - The delimiter must contain a `|`. A bare `---` is a thematic break / setext
 *    underline, NOT a GFM table delimiter (which needs matching pipe-separated
 *    cells), so counting it as "already a table" would wrongly skip deferral and
 *    let the snap happen.
