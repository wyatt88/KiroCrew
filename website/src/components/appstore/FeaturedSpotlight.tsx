/**
 * FeaturedSpotlight — one editorial card in the featured list at the top of Discover.
 *
 * Layout: artwork across the top, then editorial copy, then one row per app.
 * Art and text occupy SEPARATE planes rather than being composited, because
 * artwork arrives from a curator with no guarantee about where its bright or
 * busy region falls — title-over-image would be unreadable on some pictures and
 * nothing in the pipeline could catch it.
 *
 * TWO TYPES, ONE SHELL.
 *  - `app`: one featured app. Its own name is the heading, and the whole card
 *    opens it.
 *  - `collection`: several apps under a curator's theme. The theme is the
 *    heading, and the card itself is NOT clickable — there is no collection
 *    detail page to open, so the rows are the only targets. A card that looked
 *    clickable and did nothing would be worse than one that does not.
 *
 * Every app renders a row with its OWN install control. A member the reader
 * cannot act on is just a picture of an app, and the collection card exists to
 * be acted on.
