/**
 * Per-state reaction overrides for a crew avatar.
 *
 * A crew's avatar has one IDENTITY — the name-derived face, or the traits
 * pinned in the builder — and, on the ghost tier, a small REACTION layer on top
 * of it: a built-in motion when a turn finishes and when it ends badly, plus a
 * sound for either of those moments and for the work itself.
 *
 * Identity is never part of a reaction. A motion may move the ghost and change
 * its eyes for the moment it plays; it cannot change hat, tile or mouth, and a
 * crew that did would read as a different crew, which is the opposite of what
 * an avatar is for. The vocabulary of motions lives in `kiroGhostAvatar.ts`
 * beside the art that implements it.
 *
 * Reactions belong to the tier that can play them, so both readers here are
 * GHOST-ONLY. A picture is static and silent — there is no face to move and no
 * cue it could carry that the ghost's own vocabulary would fit. A pack brings
 * its own per-state art and its own audio files, so a preset on the crew record
 * would be a second, competing answer to the same question.
 *
 * The coercions are TOTAL, for the same reason `ghostTraitsFrom` is: these
 * values come off a config record that older and newer clients both write, and
 * a roster row carries the field untyped. An unknown MOTION name is kept
 * verbatim — `motionFrom` resolves it to the still frame, so a reaction saved
 * by a newer vocabulary renders as no reaction instead of crashing, and is
 * never replaced by a substitute the crew's author did not choose. What IS
 * rejected is a value of the wrong shape, which collapses to "no override"
 * rather than reaching the renderer.
