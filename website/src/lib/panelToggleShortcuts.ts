 * and the docked terminal.
 *
 * The chord machinery (recording, matching, platform-neutral `mod`, key-cap
 * rendering) is shared verbatim with {@link ./quickSearchShortcut}; this module
 * only adds the multi-binding storage and the one thing quick-search never
 * needed — a real UNBOUND state, so a user can clear a toggle to nothing.
 *
 * Storage holds OVERRIDES only, never the resolved bindings: a panel absent from
 * the map falls back to its {@link DEFAULT_PANEL_TOGGLE_BINDINGS} entry (so a
 * later change to a code default reaches every user who never touched it), while
 * an explicit `null` is a deliberate "unbound" the loader must preserve rather
 * than collapse back to the default. Writers broadcast
 * {@link PANEL_TOGGLE_SHORTCUTS_EVENT} so the live keydown handler and the
 * Settings / Alt+K display surfaces re-read without a reload, mirroring the
 * quick-search preference.

 * Factory-default binding per panel. `mod` is the platform primary modifier —

 * / ⌘\ on a Mac and Ctrl+B / Ctrl+\ elsewhere. The two bound defaults are
 * collision-free against the built-in chords in `useKeyboardShortcuts`.
 *
 * The left sidebar and the docked terminal both ship UNBOUND (`null`): the user
 * opts in by recording a chord in Settings.
 *
 * The terminal's reason for shipping unbound is specific, and is why no default
 * is proposed for it. Every plausible default costs a keystroke inside the shell,
 * because {@link PANEL_TOGGLES_SKIPPING_SHELL} takes its chord from the PTY by
 * design — that is the whole point of the entry. ⌘J / Ctrl+J, the obvious pick
 * (VS Code's Toggle Panel, which hosts its integrated terminal), is `^J` on
 * Windows/Linux, i.e. readline's `accept-line`: a user pressing it instead of
 * Enter would close the panel mid-command. VS Code's terminal chord proper,
 * literal `Ctrl+`` on every platform, IS recordable here (`{ key: '`', ctrl:
 * true }` on macOS, `{ key: '`', mod: true }` elsewhere), but it too spends a
 * shell keystroke, and ⌘` is the macOS window cycler. Rather than pick which
 * shell keystroke to spend on everyone's behalf, the binding is left to the user
 * who wants it — and who then knows what they traded.
