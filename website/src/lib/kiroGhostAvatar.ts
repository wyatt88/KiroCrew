/**
 * DiceBear style that generates Kiro ghosts.
 *
 * A DiceBear style is a plain object — `{ meta, schema, create({ prng, options }) }`
 * returning `{ attributes: { viewBox }, body }` — so this needs no dependency
 * beyond `@dicebear/core` and is consumed exactly like a published style pack.
 *
 * The brand mark's own art is NOT duplicated here. `kiro-ghost-mark.svg` is imported
 * as raw text and its three paths are read out of it, so the `.svg` asset is the
 * single source of truth in fact rather than by convention — the same art-as-text
 * pattern `apps/mochi/builtinPacks.ts` uses for its animation assets. That keeps
 * bespoke brand art an asset, which is the condition attached to the
 * `use-lucide-icons` exemption in `website/docs/theming-contract.md`.
 *
 * Everything is composed in the mark's own 1200x1200 coordinate space, so there is
 * no transform math that can drift, and with every trait switched off the output IS
 * the mark. What this module authors itself is the VARIANT vocabulary — eyes, brows,
 * mouths, head items, props — which is parameterised by coordinates measured off the
 * mark and therefore cannot be expressed as a set of static files.
 *
 * What is taken from the asset is GEOMETRY, not presentation. `kiro-ghost-mark.svg`
 * is itself a hollow outline (`fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="80"`), and the
 * avatar deliberately renders a filled white body with no stroke instead, which is the
 * app icon's treatment: a saturated tile behind the ghost, black eyes, no outline.
 *
 * That is not a departure from how this asset is used elsewhere — its only other
 * consumer, `components/KiroGhostMark.tsx`, paints it through `BrandGlyph` as a CSS
 * MASK over `currentColor`, discarding its fill and stroke too. And it follows the
 * doctrine `components/GhostPoses.tsx` documents: the body is white, and an outline is
 * added only where contrast demands it (there, a CSS `drop-shadow()` chain on pale
 * palettes). Here contrast is structural instead — every tile in `TILES` is held below
 * L* 78, which the test asserts, so the white silhouette always reads without a stroke.
 *
 * DRAW ORDER IS PART OF EVERY AVATAR'S IDENTITY. The prng is a single stream and
 * each question consumes exactly one step, so inserting a question re-rolls every
 * trait after it and silently changes faces that already exist. Add new traits at
 * the END of `create`, never in the middle; the test pins the trait tuple of
 * several seeds to catch a violation.
