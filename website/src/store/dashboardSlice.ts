 *  Only per-row identity is carried across, and only for a structurally equal
 *  row, so no consumer can read stale content off a reused reference. The
 *  comparison uses the shared `jsonEqual`, whose key-order independence and
 *  field-agnosticism this relies on: a row may have been patched in place by

 *  on screen — a correctness bug, where an extra re-render is only a cost.
 *
 *  Identity is load-bearing here rather than a micro-optimisation. The sidebar
 *  renders every row as a Framer `motion.div` with `layout="position"` inside one
 *  `LayoutGroup`, and every selector over `dashboard.slots` invalidates when the
 *  array or any row changes reference. Assigning the incoming array wholesale
 *  hands every row a new reference on every frame, so one slot's status change
 *  re-renders and re-measures the entire list — which reads as the sidebar
 *  reloading rather than as one session becoming active. Slot pushes coalesce at
 *  200ms server-side, so a single active turn delivers several full lists per
 *  second and the effect is continuous.
 *
 *  Skipping the assignment (rather than assigning an equal array) is the half
 *  that matters most: it leaves the array reference alone, which lets a
 *  downstream `useMemo` skip its filter and sort entirely instead of recomputing
 *  an equal result. */

     * hold two deliveries on one channel at once — the conversation it was born in
     * and an explicit mirror to that same channel — and those mute separately, so
     * channel alone is ambiguous and picked whichever row came first. The

     * so a `'both'` row is classified identically on both sides. Callers with only
     * one possible row for the channel (Slack) may omit it. `patch` leaves a row
     * that does not exist alone rather than inventing one: an invented row cannot
