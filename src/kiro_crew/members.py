"""Per-crew-member space: ``$KIROCREW_HOME/members/<slug>/``.

A crew member is the same agent running with different context, so its space
holds what belongs to that member alone rather than to the user as a whole. The
first occupant is ``activity.jsonl`` — pointers to the sessions the member took
part in, which is the signal trigger generation reads.

The directory name is a **slug**: stable, immutable, and path-safe. A member's
display name is editable independently, so a rename never has to move files.
This mirrors the artifact store's ``artifacts/<slug>/`` layout, and reuses its
:func:`~kiro_crew.artifacts.slugify` so both surfaces normalize names the same
way.

Activity entries are pointers by design: they carry the session key, not a copy
of what happened. Details are read back from the session itself, so the log
cannot drift from the transcript — and it survives session pruning, which is why
frequency counts taken from it stay stable.

    The file is AGENT-WRITTEN, so two properties are enforced at the open,
    not after it:

    * **No symlink following anywhere on the path, no non-regular files, no
      blocking open.** The gateway reads this file with its own privileges
      while building context, so a briefing replaced by a symlink would pull
      any gateway-readable file — including the keystone-gated ``trust/``
      payloads the agent's tools cannot reach — into the prompt, and a
      briefing replaced by a FIFO would make a plain ``open`` block forever,
      hanging the member's turn and exhausting the embed workers. The leaf is
      opened through :func:`~kiro_crew.pinned_fs.open_in_pinned_parent`, which
      walks the ancestor chain one descriptor-relative ``openat`` at a time,
      each carrying ``O_NOFOLLOW`` — an ``O_NOFOLLOW`` on the final component
      alone is not enough, because the member's own directory
      (``members/<slug>/``) is agent-writable too, and swapping IT for a link
      redirects the whole traversal while the leaf open still finds an
      ordinary file (the same ancestor-swap shape the pinned walk exists to close).
      ``O_NONBLOCK`` makes a FIFO open return immediately instead of waiting
      for a writer (both at open time — no check-then-open race); ``fstat``
      then rejects anything that is not a regular file. Where the pinned walk
      or ``O_NOFOLLOW`` is unavailable (Windows —
      :func:`member_briefing_supported`) the read FAILS CLOSED to "no
      briefing": a check-then-open probe is exactly the TOCTOU an
      agent-writable path invites (swap a symlink in after the check), and
      the repo's posture on hosts lacking an OS-level control is to refuse,
      not to run the racy approximation.
    * **Bounded read.** At most ``(cap + 2) * 4`` bytes are read (4 = max
      UTF-8 bytes per char), so an arbitrarily large briefing costs a bounded
      allocation, never gateway memory.

    read-only home, a torn write — is handled here and reported ``False``. This
    is best-effort by contract; a logging failure must never break the turn that
    triggered it, and one call site (``mcp_core``) has no logger of its own.

    ``memory_mode`` is REQUIRED and positional, not an opt-in keyword: it gates
    whether the session may be recorded at all, and a caller that simply forgot
    it would durably log a private session. It is matched against an allowlist
    (:data:`_TRACEABLE_MEMORY_MODES`), so an absent, empty or unrecognized mode
    skips the write rather than passing through.

    ``dedupe_session`` suppresses a repeat entry for a member/session pair. The
    chat site needs it because its ``is_new`` flag tracks the PROVIDER session,
    not the conversation: a dead provider cold-starts the same conversation with
    ``is_new=True`` again, which would append the same pointer twice and inflate
    the counts this log exists to feed. Routing decisions are NOT deduped — each
    ``select_crew`` bind is a distinct event even for one session.

    ``via`` records HOW the member was chosen, because the two call sites mean
    different things and a mixed log cannot be read apart afterwards:

    * ``"chat"`` — the human picked this member for the session.
    * ``"select_crew"`` — the orchestrator judged this member fits the task.

    A ``select_crew`` entry records the routing *decision*, not an execution:
    binding a crew does not oblige the model to delegate to it. That is the
