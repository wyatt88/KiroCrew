"""The KiroCrew Governance Model — archetypes, ceiling, evaluator, loader.

This module is the **decoupled, extensible core** of the two-level governance
model (see ``docs/system-specs/modules/governance.md`` and the design doc).
Governance is defined at two levels resolved by a single rule — *the tightest
boundary wins*:

* **Level 1 — POLICY** (``GovernanceCeiling``): the enterprise security ceiling,
  loaded once at boot from a trust-root path the agent process does not own.
  Once present, the running app and its agent cannot weaken it.
* **Level 2 — PROFILE** (``Profile``): a per-surface / per-app / per-task scope
  that may only *narrow* what policy permits.

The effective permission for any item is ``policy ∩ profile``.

Design invariant — **four archetypes, one algebra each.**  Every governed
control is exactly one of ``ScopedRuleset`` (a named set, opt-in/opt-out),
``OrdinalControl`` (a value on a strictness scale), ``CapabilityGate`` (on/off +
named sub-sets) or ``ScopedMap`` (an allowlist of members each carrying a
posture).

**Why this is decoupled / reusable / extensible** (the explicit acceptance
criterion): the evaluator never branches on a scope *name*.  It composes and
queries controls purely through archetype polymorphism (every archetype exposes
``permits``/``query``), and the two domain-specific concerns that *do* vary —
how an item string matches a pattern (``_MATCHERS``) and how an ordinal's tiers
rank (``_ORDINAL_SCALES``) — live in **enforcer-owned registries**, never in the
policy/profile document.  Adding a new governed scope (a new MCP-server
grouping, a new chat transport, a new capability) is therefore a *data* change:
one row in ``SCOPE_CATALOG`` plus, at most, one matcher/scale registry entry.  No
change to ``resolve`` / ``compose`` / ``assert_governance_floor`` is ever
required — the test suite proves this by registering a synthetic scope and
resolving it with zero evaluator edits.

    Case-sensitive (POSIX path semantics).  ``fnmatch``'s ``*`` already crosses
    directory separators, which is the documented (broad) behaviour for a
    deny-oriented read block; callers wanting precise segment semantics should
    prefer narrower patterns.

    Only the ITEM is normalized (``_norm_item``: expand → absolutize → lexically
    collapse ``.``/``..``); the PATTERN is only ``~``/``$VAR``-expanded and is
    matched verbatim.  Normalizing the item — never the pattern — does two jobs
    and avoids one trap:

    * a ``..`` traversal cannot satisfy an ALLOW-mode prefix:
      ``/home/u/ws/../.bashrc`` normalizes to ``/home/u/.bashrc`` and does not
      fnmatch ``/home/u/ws/**`` (without this ``*`` spans the ``..`` and the
      write is wrongly PERMITTED though the OS resolves it outside the allow-list);
    * an agent-supplied RELATIVE item is anchored to an absolute form, so it can
      still match an absolute DENY glob (``../../etc/passwd`` cannot dodge
      ``/etc/**``) instead of silently failing to match and falling open;
    * the trap avoided: ``os.path.normpath`` must NOT touch the pattern — it treats
      ``*``/``**`` as ordinary segments and collapses an adjacent ``..`` against
      them (``/a/**/../b`` → ``/a/b``, silently dropping the ``**``), which would
      widen an allow / shrink a deny.  Matching the pattern verbatim preserves the
      operator's authored globs exactly.

    Normalization is purely lexical (no filesystem ``resolve()``), so it adds no
    I/O.  The relative-item anchor is the host process CWD (the same anchor the
    resolved ``is_sensitive_path`` keystone uses); it cannot perfectly reconstruct
    a backend's CWD, so that always-on keystone remains the authoritative,
    resolved block for the trust-root / credential dirs.

    LEXICAL-ONLY CONTRACT (no ``realpath``): matching does NOT resolve symlinks.
    A symlink that lexically sits inside an allow-prefix
    (``<allow>/link -> <secret>/key``) passes ``_match_path`` even though the OS
    write lands at ``<secret>/key`` outside the allow-list.  This is intentional:
    resolving would add filesystem I/O on every gate call and would refuse writes
    through symlinks an operator placed deliberately (a common workspace layout).
    The contract is therefore: **allow-mode prefixes are a lexical scoping aid,
    not a hardened sandbox against symlinks** — the resolved ``is_sensitive_path``
    keystone (which DOES ``resolve()``) is the authoritative guard for the
    trust-root / credential dirs, and an operator must not rely on an allow-mode
    prefix to confine writes in a directory that contains untrusted symlinks.

    1. ``_expand`` — ``~`` / ``$VAR`` substitution.
    2. ``os.path.abspath`` — anchor a relative path (e.g. ``../../etc/passwd`` or
       ``etc/passwd``) to the host CWD so it cannot dodge an absolute DENY glob by
       failing to match; ``abspath`` also runs ``normpath``, collapsing ``..``.

    """Map a tool's semantic ``kind`` + real arguments to ``(scope, item)`` pairs.

    This is the args-based companion to :func:`classify_tool_title`.  The display
    title is backend-variable and unreliable for extracting a path or URL, but the
    ACP event carries the tool's ``kind`` and ``raw_tool_params`` — the
    authoritative signal.  Used by the gate to enforce the path/host scopes that a
    title cannot carry:

    * ``kind == "edit"`` → ``("filesystem.write", "<path>")`` for every path in
      the edit's judged target set: the UNION of the params' path spellings and
      *diff_path*, the path the tool call's diff content block named
      (:func:`kiro_crew.platform.tool_paths.edit_target_candidates`, the same
      single source the hooks edit gate consumes).  A backend may stream trusted
      params that carry no path key and name the file only in that block, so
      classifying the params alone would hand an ALLOW-mode ``filesystem.write``
      confinement a pathless edit — the write it exists to confine would never
      be asked.  A *diff_path* still relative after ``~``/env expansion emits
      ``_UNANCHORED_TARGET_ITEM`` (see below) instead of a path.
    * ``kind == "read"`` with a path argument →
      ``("filesystem.read", "<path>")``
      (redundant with the ``Reading`` title path, harmless — both must permit).
    * ``kind == "fetch"`` with a ``url`` → ``("network.egress", "<host>")`` —
      the host is extracted from the URL so the ``host`` matcher applies.

    **Empty/unknown ``kind`` fallback (the `kind` field is spec-OPTIONAL — some
    ACP backends omit it, so it arrives ``""``).**  When the kind is not one of
    the known fs/fetch kinds, we infer from the param SHAPE so an edit/fetch is
    still governed: a ``url``/``uri`` (and no shell ``command``) → egress; a
    ``path``/``file_path``/``filePath`` (and no shell ``command``) → BOTH read and write
    (we cannot tell read from write without the kind, so we apply both ceilings —
    an ungoverned one permits, so this only tightens and never misroutes a shell
    command, which carries ``command`` and is governed by the ``commands`` scope).

    Returns an empty tuple when the params carry no governed item (an ungoverned
    scope permits, so this only ever tightens).

    **Truncated scan (open-question-2 policy on this permit-by-default plane).**
    The shared path walk is bounded (``_TARGET_PATH_MAX_PATHS`` /
    ``_TARGET_PATH_MAX_NODES``); a payload padded past those caps returns a
    ``truncated`` result whose path list may be INCOMPLETE.  On this plane a
    truncated scan that yielded no path must NOT silently reach the caller's
    permit-by-default ``if not pairs`` branch — that is exactly the fail-open the
    reported bypass exploits (bury the governed path past 10_000 nodes to escape
    the operator ceiling).  The keystone in ``hooks`` fails SAFE by hard-denying
    any truncated scan, but this plane is permit-by-default and must NOT
    blanket-deny an UNGOVERNED standalone host that happens to send a huge
    payload.  So we thread the needle (issue option (c)): on truncation we emit
    the filesystem scope(s) the ``tool_kind`` implies against a synthetic,
    never-permittable item (``_TRUNCATED_SCAN_ITEM``).  Result: an operator
    ceiling that governs that filesystem scope DENIES the unverifiable call
    (closing the fail-open), while an ungoverned scope still permits it (the
    standalone default is preserved, and no unrelated scope is touched).  The
    truncation is auditable via the synthetic item text in the denial reason.
    Rejected alternatives: (a) permit as before = keep the fail-open; (b) deny the
    whole call unconditionally = over-blocks ungoverned hosts and every unrelated
    scope.

    **Unanchored diff path — the same needle, threaded the same way.**  A
    relative diff-block path resolves against the process CWD, so its membership
    in an allow-list cannot be established; ``edit_target_candidates`` withholds
    it and sets ``unanchored``, and this plane emits
    ``("filesystem.write", _UNANCHORED_TARGET_ITEM)``: a governed
    ``filesystem.write`` scope denies the unverifiable edit, an ungoverned one
    permits.  (The hooks edit gate additionally hard-denies the unanchored shape
    outright for its callers — this marker is the governance plane's own
    fail-safe reading, not the primary deny.)

    Precise semantics of the marker against the two ruleset modes (both correct):
    a PREFIX-BOUNDED ALLOW-mode ceiling (``allow: ['~/workspace/**']`` — confine
    to a workspace, the exact profile the reported bypass targets) does NOT match
    the synthetic item, so the truncated call is DENIED — the fail-open is closed.
    (A CATCH-ALL ALLOW pattern — ``**`` / ``/**`` / ``*`` — does match the marker
    because fnmatch ``*`` crosses separators, so it permits the truncated scan;
    that is not a bypass, since such a ceiling confines nothing and is
    unconstrained anyway.)  A DENY-mode
    ceiling that blocks only specific paths (``deny: ['~/secrets/**']``) permits
    the marker, because a targeted deny is not a general confinement and a partial
    scan cannot prove the buried path hit that one pattern; the always-on,
    resolved ``is_sensitive_path`` keystone in ``hooks`` (which hard-denies ANY
    truncated scan) remains the authoritative guard for the sensitive tiers there.

# which configures publish's destinations without stating whether publish is on,

# It does NOT apply when the key is absent.  ``_parse_controls`` materializes only

# absent scope, and ``resolve`` PERMITS an absent scope (``_PERMIT_NOT_GOVERNED``)
# exactly as it does for an unnamed ``mcp``, ``commands`` or ``network.egress``.
# Omission means ungoverned-and-permitted for every archetype; capabilities are
# not a special case, and making them one would put a namespace-specific rule in
# a loader whose whole contract is that a newly registered scope family parses
# without a loader edit.
#
# Consequence for authors, and the reason a governed fleet should enumerate all of

# validate`` reports a partially-governed ``capabilities`` block so the gap is

# deliberately TOLERATED (skipped + recorded on ``Profile.unknown_scopes``, see
# ``_parse_controls``) so a data home shared with an edition that registers extra
# rows still loads. A rename would land in that tolerant path and silently stop
# governing, instead of surfacing. (A renamed row declared ``enabled: false`` still

    location, and each host fetches it, caches the last-known-good copy, and
    re-fetches on an interval so a pushed change lands without a restart or a
    redeploy.  ``kiro_crew.platform.policy_distribution`` is the engine; this
    dataclass is only the parsed declaration.

    **Not a governed scope**, for the same reason :class:`UpdatePins` is not: every
    archetype answers "is X permitted?", while a URL and an interval are *values

    would not be a narrowing — it would be a total replacement of the enforcement

    keeping the flag out of ``security_policy.json`` — "an attacker rewriting the
    policy would simply clear it".  Mandating a verified signature is
    ``require_policy_signature`` in the operator-controlled admission policy, which is
    on the keystone and which a fetched document cannot reach; this tier honours it
    like every other tier.

    **No credentials live here.**  ``headers`` is deliberately absent: a document
    published to the whole fleet must not carry a per-machine secret, and this one
    is additionally copied into a local cache and reported on by the read-only
    policy viewer.  A request credential is per-machine configuration and comes

    """Flatten a policy/profile JSON body into the catalog's dotted-scope map.

    Data-driven against ``SCOPE_CATALOG`` so a newly ``register_scope``'d family
    parses with no loader edit (the extensibility contract):

    * a top-level key that is itself a flat catalog scope is taken directly;
    * a nested namespace (``<key>.<sub>`` exists in the catalog) descends
      generically — every child ``<sub>`` that resolves to a catalog scope is
      parsed, and an unknown child fails closed;
    * ``capabilities`` (and any registered key-open namespace) maps each child to
      ``<key>.<child>``, deferring the known/unknown decision to the catalog.

    An unknown governed key fails closed (tamper-evidence / Rule 8), with ONE
    narrow exception: see ``unknown_out``.

    ``unknown_out`` opts into KEY-OPEN TOLERANCE and is passed ONLY by
    :func:`parse_profile`. When present, an unknown child of a key-open namespace
    (``capabilities.*``) does not invalidate the profile — but ONLY in the
    ASYMMETRIC case where the child is a dict whose ``enabled`` is exactly
    ``True``. Such a child is skipped, warned about, and appended here for the
    caller to record on ``Profile.unknown_scopes``. Every KNOWN sibling in the same
    block still parses and is still enforced.

    Every OTHER unknown child — ``enabled: false``, ``enabled`` absent, a non-dict
    value, anything malformed — RAISES exactly as it did before the tolerance
    existed, so the loader degrades the whole profile to its bind-preserving
    deny-all fallback.

    Why the rule is asymmetric, and why it is profile-only:

    * a profile is **narrow-only**, and the intersection is performed by
      :func:`resolve` (rule-2 intersect of ceiling ∘ profile), so an unknown
      ``enabled: true`` cannot change ANY decision in ANY build: if the scope is
      unregistered there is nothing to decide, and if a later build registers it
      the profile merely declines to narrow it. Skipping it therefore loses
      nothing, and that holds even when the key is a typo;
    * an unknown NARROWING (``enabled: false``, or a malformed child whose intent
      cannot be read) is indistinguishable from a typo'd narrowing of a CORE
      capability — ``{"spwan": {"enabled": false}}`` reads exactly like a failed
      attempt to disable ``spawn``. Honoring the operator's intent requires
      failing closed there: the loud deny-all fallback surfaces the typo, whereas
      tolerating it would silently grant what the operator tried to deny;
    * the POLICY/ceiling path keeps raising (``unknown_out`` stays ``None``), so
      tamper-evidence on the ceiling is unchanged (Rule 8). The policy's optional
      top-level ``fallback`` object parses with ``is_policy=False`` but no
      ``unknown_out``, so it fails closed at boot;
    * unknown **top-level** governed families still fail closed either way — only
      children inside an already-known key-open family are eligible.

    The concrete defect this fixes: the internal edition ``register_scope``s extra
    ``capabilities.*`` rows and seeds a profile naming them with ``enabled: true``;
    a public edition reading the SAME data home rejects that whole profile and
    degrades the surface to deny-all. Cross-edition data-home sharing is supported,
    so an inert declaration must not be fatal.

    Accepted residual: a typo'd capability name carrying ``enabled: true`` is
    tolerated rather than surfaced. That is inert by the first bullet above (it
    could not have changed a decision), so the cost is a missed diagnostic, not a
    permission change. ``Profile.unknown_scopes`` is what surfaces it.

    This relies on ``SCOPE_CATALOG`` being APPEND-ONLY (a scope is added or
    retired, never renamed in place) — otherwise a renamed key declared
    ``enabled: true`` would be silently tolerated instead of surfacing as the
    migration it is.

    ceiling an edition tightened. The packaged resource is static for the process.

    (unreadable, or one ``parse_policy`` rejects) beneath a present authority was

    property of the primitive rather than a rule this function has to police.

    A scope the subordinate governs and the authority does not carries through:
    an ungoverned scope is *unrestricted*, so adding a restriction to it is a
    tightening, not an escape.  A scope the authority governs and the subordinate
    does not keeps the authority's value, because a subordinate cannot repeal by
    omission.

    Everything outside ``controls`` stays the AUTHORITY's -- identity, signature
    state, tier, distribution pins and the update *commands* -- except the two update
    pins that are themselves restrictions, which fold (:func:`_intersect_update_pins`).
    (The distribution pins are additionally re-applied by :func:`compose_tier_ladder`,

    pins at all, where keeping "the authority's" would discard the pins of the tier
    beneath it rather than preserve a choice.  Within a single intersection the rule
    below still holds.)
    A subordinate document must not be able to relabel whose ceiling this is, relax
    an update pin, redirect where the next document is fetched from, or widen its
    own escape hatch.

    Every field outside ``controls`` falls into one of three classes, and the class
    decides its precedence rule.  Get the class wrong and a lower tier widens the
    ceiling through a side door ``_compose_controls`` never sees -- or, the mirror
    failure, a lower tier's restriction is silently voided:

    * **A restriction that folds** -- ``updates.source`` (an allowlist; empty permits
      any remote) and ``updates.min_version`` (a floor; empty is none).  A subordinate
      supplying one where the authority left it empty NARROWS the ceiling, so it is
      kept; where both set one, the authority's source stands and the higher floor
      wins.  Keeping "the authority's" here would discard a pure tightening and let
      code install from a source the local operator forbade.
    * **Absence means "no choice expressed"** -- ``distribution`` pins.  Nothing above
      chose, so a lower tier supplying one redirects nothing; ``compose_tier_ladder``
      lets the first declared value through.
    * **Absence means the fail-closed floor** -- ``fallback_profile``, ``tier``,
      identity, signature state, and the update *commands* (``check_command``,
      ``apply_command``, ``platform_commands``: a command runs unsandboxed as the
      gateway, so a lower tier supplying one is an escalation, not a restriction).
      Authority-only, never ``authority.x or subordinate.x``.  For
      ``fallback_profile`` specifically: an authority that declared none means an
      unusable profile file denies its whole surface, and a subordinate supplying a
      looser fallback would REPLACE that floor -- the escape hatch widened by the
      tier that is not allowed to widen anything.  A subordinate that wants a

       caller that knows the active edition.  The public core passes ``None``.
    4. ``~/.kiro/crew/security_policy.json`` — standalone operator-authored.
    5. None → editable secure-defaults (standalone, ungoverned ceiling).

    document can add restrictions but never remove one.

    **Why the env tier sits beneath the central push.**  An env tier that outranks
    the fleet document is a rollback lever, and a rollback lever makes the enterprise
    ceiling advisory: any account that can set an environment variable could point it
    at a permissive file and the fleet's ceiling would never bind.  There is no local
    rollback lever in this ladder: recovery from a bad central push is by
    re-publishing a good document at the source, and a local, time-boxed override is
    tracked as a follow-up issue (see the enterprise governance guide) rather than
    provided here.

    A **present-but-unreadable / invalid** policy at the env path, or at the home
    path when it is the only ceiling, raises ``PlatformCompositionError``
    (fail-closed to strictest), mirroring ``admission.load_admission_policy`` — a
    fleet that meant to enforce something must never silently fall open.  Beneath a
    central document the home file is the one exception: it is skipped with a
    once-per-process warning and the authority governs unchanged
    (:func:`_subordinate_ceiling`), because raising there would let whoever owns
    ``~/.kiro/crew`` refuse boot and freeze every refresh on a fleet host while the
    ceiling itself is unaffected.

    **Signature verification (``identity.signature``).**  Every tier's document is
    checked as it is read, so every ``GovernanceCeiling`` carries its own verdict.
    The verdict is recorded on ``GovernanceCeiling.signature_state`` and is
    **advisory by default**, so existing installs and policy files keep working
    unchanged.  ``require_policy_signature`` in the admission policy makes a verified
    signature mandatory.  Enforcement lives in
    :func:`assert_policy_signature_satisfied`, which runs once on the FINAL composed
    ceiling — this function is called more than once per boot with different
