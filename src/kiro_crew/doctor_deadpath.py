"""Doctor check: agent specs whose command/args/env paths no longer exist.

Agent spec JSONs in the shared kiro agents dir rot. A spec's ``mcpServers``
entry can point at paths that stop existing — a removed venv, a reaped
temporary checkout, a relocated tool. The symptom is silent and expensive:
every new session selecting that agent starts with its first-party MCP servers
dead (spawn fails on a nonexistent command), or resolves secrets against a dead
data home and surfaces ``internal_auth_mismatch``. Nothing names the dead path.

This module walks every agent spec JSON in :func:`kiro_agents_dir_path` and
stats every absolute ``command`` path, absolute path-like arg, and absolute
path-like env value. Values that only LOOK like paths are screened out first —
separator-joined lists, and the operands of flags that take an opaque identifier
(see :data:`_IDENTIFIER_FLAGS`) — because a false "dead path" on a healthy
install turns the whole check red and teaches operators to ignore it:

* **Managed specs** (the ones ``install_agent`` / ``rebuild_agent_config`` own,
  i.e. :data:`~kiro_crew.agent_files.OWNED_KIRO_AGENT_FILES`) with dead paths are
  repaired automatically via the existing rebuild path, then re-verified.
* **Foreign specs** (other tools' agents sharing the directory) are report-only,
  naming the spec file, the server name, and the dead path. Kiro Crew never
  rewrites what it does not own.
* **Malformed / unreadable spec JSON** is reported, never crashing the whole
  check (fail-open per file).

Kept deliberately self-contained — one module, one public entry point
(:func:`check_dead_paths`) plus a thin doctor renderer
(:func:`doctor_dead_paths`) — so the doctor wiring is a single call and a
sibling change wiring another sweep into doctor rebases trivially.
