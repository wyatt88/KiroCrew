"""App registry — curated list of available KiroCrew apps.

The registry JSON (``app-registry.json``) is a minimal index: just app name,
git URL, branch, and install metadata.  All display information (description,
screenshots, highlights, tags, platform) comes from each app's own
``app.json``, fetched on demand and cached locally.

This "single source of truth" design means app authors only maintain their
own ``app.json`` — they never need to update the KiroCrew registry JSON
when changing descriptions, screenshots, or versions.

Each registry entry identifies the source repository via a ``gitUrl`` field
(any git-cloneable URL — ``https://github.com/...``, ``git@host:...``, etc.).
The legacy ``repo`` field is still accepted and, when no ``gitUrl`` is given,
is used as a clone target directly (so a full URL may be placed in ``repo``).

SECURITY — Trust model:
  registry JSON (gitUrl + branch) → ``git clone`` from the configured host →
  read app.json → execute setup.onInstall script.

The registry entry itself is curated/reviewed before being shipped, and the
install script in app.json has the same trust level as any code you clone
and build locally.  Install scripts run sandboxed via ``wrap_argv`` with a
minimal environment that excludes process secrets.

    Confused-deputy defense (companion to :func:`is_clone_host_trusted`): the
    clone-host trust gate is deliberately **host-granular**, so a host the owner
    configured for one registry (e.g. their internal forge) is trusted wholesale.
    A configured registry's ``app-registry.json`` is UNTRUSTED content, so it can
    list an app whose ``repo`` points at a *sibling* private repo on that same
    trusted host. The manifest/blob-proxy paths clone such repos **automatically**
    on browse/refresh — with no per-repo owner action — so cloning them with the
    gateway's ambient git/ssh identity would be a confused-deputy read of a
    private sibling repo, surfaced back through the App Store. Such automatic
    clones therefore run **credential-free / anonymous**:

    - drop the SSH agent + ``GIT_SSH``/``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` passthrough
      (``_GIT_CREDENTIAL_ENV_KEYS``) so no ssh key/agent is ever offered;
    - disable system **and** global git config (``GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`` +
      ``GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=os.devnull``) so no HTTPS credential helper fires;
    - never prompt (``GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0``, plus a batch-mode
      ``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` with no identity/agent) so a private repo simply fails
      to clone (→ graceful fallback) instead of authenticating as the gateway.

    Callers must ALSO pass ``mode="strict"`` to :func:`wrap_argv` so the OS
    sandbox hides ``~/.ssh`` — env suppression and the sandbox are belt-and-
    suspenders on the same credential-free property.

    Credential posture by clone origin (all four paths gate on
    :func:`is_clone_host_trusted` first):

    - **Automatic** browse/refresh clones (manifest + blob proxy) — always
      credential-free / anonymous (this function), because no per-repo owner
      action gates them.
    - **Index-originated installs** — an app whose registry entry came from an
      owner-configured *external* index (carries ``_registry``): the ``repo``
      URL is index-controlled, so the install clone is ALSO credential-free
      (``anonymous_git_env`` + strict sandbox); the owner designated the index
      URL, not the app's repo. See :func:`_git_clone_or_pull`'s
      ``index_originated`` flag.
    - **Bundled / owner-designated installs** — the curated bundled registry (no
      ``_registry`` marker) and fetching the owner's own configured registry
      index keep full credentials via :func:`minimal_env`; those repos are
      deliberately owner-designated.

    Every consumer of the registry list goes through here, so an edition-pinned
    registry is visible to index fetch/refresh, the trusted-host allowlist, row
    lookup, install, and the blob-proxy allowlist alike. A seam wired into only
    some of those would surface an app the install path then refuses — the
    half-implemented-mechanism failure mode.

    Merge rule: an **edition default wins** on a ``name`` collision, and when the
    two rows name DIFFERENT repositories **neither is served**. The second half is
    not fastidiousness: the on-disk index cache is keyed by registry NAME, so the
    displaced row's cache would be read under the winning row's identity and every
    reader stamps ``_registry`` from the registry it asked for — apps the pinned
    repository does not list, attributed to it and installable under it. Refusing
    the ambiguous name makes that a visible, diagnosable state instead. The
    credential path is separately safe (``_owner_tier_confirmed`` re-reads the
    real index), so this is about provenance, not escalation.

    Same name AND same repo is not a conflict — the pinned row simply supersedes
    an operator row that already agreed with it, and the shared cache is correct.

    Operators can add registries freely; they just cannot silently repoint one the
    edition pinned. ``PUT /api/apps/registries`` refuses to create such a
    collision, so the case that survives here is a ``config.json`` that already
    used the name before the build pinned it.

    Edition rows come first, which is also the lookup precedence
    :func:`_registry_app_candidates` documents, so a pinned registry is the first
    row consulted for a same-named app. A config-load failure degrades to the
    pinned rows alone rather than raising — the security gates must keep

    The credential escalation an organisation-wide registry needs cannot come from

    and a real catalog's apps live in other repos. But it also cannot simply
    believe the row, because the row reaching this point was read from
    ``_read_external_registry_cache`` — **agent-writable** content, as
    :func:`_resolve_registry_row` says of the same file when it refuses to resolve
    an install from it. Trusting the tier on a cached row would let anything able
    to write that cache name an arbitrary repo on the operator's own forge and
    have it cloned with the gateway's git identity: the confused-deputy read the
    anonymous posture exists to prevent, merely relocated from the index to its
    cache.

    So the tier is honoured only after a FRESH fetch of that registry's index
    confirms an entry whose clone URL is **byte-identical** to this one's. That
    mirrors the official catalog, whose install coordinates likewise never come
    from a cache. Consequences, all deliberate:

    - **Install only.** Callers are the explicit per-app install action. The
      automatic browse/refresh clones keep the credential-free posture
      unconditionally, per :func:`anonymous_git_env`'s contract — they are not
      gated by any owner action, and a network round trip per listed row would be
      the wrong cost anyway.
    - **Fail closed, never fall back.** An unreachable index, a parse failure, a
      missing entry, or a URL that does not match exactly all return ``False``,
      which leaves the anonymous posture in place. The cost is availability on a
      path that already needs the network to clone.
    - **The fresh index is authority for the URL only.** It cannot promote the
      tier (that is read from operator/edition config) and it cannot widen the
      host set (``is_clone_host_trusted`` still gates the clone).
    - **Every install coordinate must match, not just the URL.** ``branch`` and
      ``subdirectory`` reach the clone from the same cached row, and
      :func:`_apply_configured_branch` forces the configured branch only onto
      **same-repo** entries — an owner-tier registry's apps are cross-repo by
      definition, so their branch declaration survives from the cache. Matching
      the URL alone would leave a poisoned row free to keep the curated URL and
      swap the ref, or point ``subdirectory`` at another app's directory in the
      same repo, and have either cloned with credentials and its setup script
      run. So the fresh row must agree on name, URL, branch AND subdirectory.

    explicitly-configured external registries (``_configured_registry_hosts``).

    Why this exists: registry ``repo`` fields are now full git URLs, and a
    configured external (federated) registry's ``app-registry.json`` is
    UNTRUSTED content — it can list an app whose ``repo`` points at an internal
    address (e.g. ``https://127.0.0.1:8443/x``) or any attacker-controlled host.
    Such a value passes ``_is_safe_repo_identifier`` and enters the blob-proxy

    the App Store would drive ``git clone`` against the loopback/internal
    network — an authenticated backend SSRF. Constraining every URL clone to an
    explicitly-trusted HOST closes that vector and is immune to DNS rebinding:
    the hostname itself must be trusted, not its (re-resolvable) IP. An

    stays allowed precisely because the owner added it; an index-injected host
    never is.

    The mtime refresh runs BEFORE the rename, so the moved-aside directory
    already carries a fresh retention clock the instant it appears under its
    sweep-recognized ``.stale-*`` name. This closes a concurrent-sweep race the
    old rename-then-utime ordering left open: between ``dest.rename(aside)``
    landing and a following ``os.utime(aside)`` completing, *aside* is already
    visible under the sweepable name while still holding the checkout's OLD
    (possibly already-expired) mtime, so a CONCURRENT ``install_from_registry``
    running the age-based sweep in that sub-syscall window could delete the
    user's recovery copy. Refreshing *dest* first means *aside* is never
    observable under a swept name with a stale clock — the two syscalls stay in
    one ``asyncio.to_thread`` invocation, so a cancellation between them cannot
    reorder them either.

    The mtime refresh is NOT best-effort. A moved-aside checkout is the user's
    recovery copy, and the fresh mtime is the whole retention window: a
    checkout already older than :data:`_STALE_CHECKOUT_RETENTION_DAYS` would be
    sweep-eligible the instant it appears under the ``.stale-*`` name if its
    mtime were not renewed, so a silently-swallowed ``utime`` failure would hand
    the age-based sweep a green light to delete the recovery copy on the very
    next install. So a ``utime`` failure fails CLOSED before anything moves:
    *dest* has not been renamed yet, so it is still the caller's checkout at its
    original path with its original clock untouched, and this simply re-raises.
    Nothing is ever stranded under a ``.stale-*`` name by a failed refresh
    because the refresh precedes the rename. The caller
    (:func:`_move_checkout_aside`) turns the re-raised error into a ``None``
    return, and every caller of that fails closed with the non-destructive
    ``stale_clone_not_removed`` refusal — the checkout is left in place.

    Only once the refresh SUCCEEDS is the rename attempted. ``Path.rename`` is a
    single atomic syscall: it either moves *dest* to *aside* (now carrying the
    fresh clock) or leaves *dest* exactly where it was, so a rename failure
    strands nothing and re-raises for the same fail-closed handling. The
    round-11 :class:`_MoveAsideUndoFailed` retained-path contract is preserved
    on the caller side: its handler still reports the exact ``.stale-*`` path if
    a checkout is ever found stranded there (e.g. the cancellation-settlement
    undo below), so no recovery copy is ever swept unnamed.

    Returns the new path, or ``None`` if the rename failed. Nothing is ever
    deleted here: the caller reports the failure and the retention sweep owns the
    moved-aside directory's eventual removal. The mtime refresh now runs BEFORE
    the rename, so a refresh failure fails closed with *dest* untouched at its
    original path and strands nothing under a ``.stale-*`` name — it surfaces as
    the ``Could not move aside`` log line and a ``None`` return. The
    ``.stale-*`` retained-path report (via :class:`_MoveAsideUndoFailed`) is
    still emitted for the one residual strander, the cancellation-settlement
    undo below, so no stranded recovery copy is ever left unreported.

    Report durability: every branch that strands a recovery copy at a
    ``.stale-*`` path records it with ``logger.warning`` as well as appending to
    *log_lines*. The request-local list is discarded when a gateway shutdown
    cancels the update before it returns (the response the list renders into is
    never sent), so a list-only report would leave the age-based sweep to delete
    an unnamed recovery copy. The durable process-log line is what survives that
    shutdown, so the retained path is always recoverable.

    Cancellation safety: the rename+mtime-refresh runs on a retained worker
    future, and the handler SETTLES that worker before inspecting *aside*.
    Cancelling the awaiting task does not cancel a thread already running in
    the executor -- ``asyncio.Future.cancel()`` returns while the worker runs
    on -- so a bare ``if aside.exists():`` check would race the in-thread
    rename: a worker past dispatch but pre-rename at check time would complete
    the rename after the handler re-raised, stranding the checkout at *aside*
    unrecorded. Awaiting the worker to completion first makes the inspection
    deterministic: if the rename ran, this synchronously moves *aside* back to
    *dest* so the caller's state is unchanged by the attempt; if that undo
    itself fails, the aside path is logged durably (``logger.warning``, so it is
    never silently strandable even when the cancelling shutdown discards
    *log_lines*) before the cancellation is re-raised. Repeated cancellation
    does NOT get
    to skip that undo-or-log: the worker is an executor THREAD and will finish
    regardless of how many times the awaiting task is cancelled, so the
    settlement loop absorbs every further ``CancelledError`` until the worker
    future is done, THEN runs the synchronous undo-or-log, THEN re-raises a
    single ``CancelledError``. The earlier "acceptable to skip on a second
    cancel" behavior was wrong by this PR's own standard: a skipped undo leaves
    the checkout at an UNREPORTED ``.stale-*`` path that the retention sweep
    later deletes -- exactly the silent-deletion class this surface exists to
    close, and an mtime refresh only delays the sweep, it does not report the
    path. No new ``await`` runs after settlement: the undo/log is synchronous
    so it cannot itself be interrupted.

    """Stamp server-computed trust fields on every row.

    SECURITY CONTRACT: these fields are the API trust boundary for
    ``GET /api/apps/registry``. They are computed here — where the
    server-attached ``_registry`` tag is authoritative — and OVERWRITE any
    value an index entry may have published, so an external registry can
    never spoof them. Client code must read these fields and must not
    re-derive trust from the absence of ``_registry``, an internal tagging
    detail. ``_registry`` stays in the payload: the external-source label
    text, older clients, ``appManifest.ts::keysFor`` (first-party copy
    gate), and ``pickFeatured``'s legacy arm all still read it — do not
    stop emitting or rename it without migrating those dependants.

    Per row:

    - ``provenance``: ``"external"`` when ``_registry`` is set (the tag is
      applied server-side per configured registry and cannot be forged by
      index content); otherwise ``"builtin"`` when ``origin == "builtin"``,
      else ``"official"``.

      ``"official"`` means "an app WE list", and the bundled
      ``app-registry.json`` is one delivery of that list — the offline seed
      that ships inside the wheel. It answers the same question the remote
      signed catalog answers, so it gets the same value rather than a second
      one: two provenance values for one claim would put a weaker integrity
      guarantee (rides on the install artifact, cannot be revoked before the
      next release) behind a label a client cannot tell apart from the
      stronger one. The value names WHOSE list an app is on; how that list
      reached the client is a separate axis, and belongs in a separate field
      once there is more than one answer to record.

      ``"core"`` was the previous spelling. Clients accept both during the
      migration, so an older gateway's rows still label correctly.
    - ``verified``: ``True`` only when provenance is NOT ``"external"`` AND
      (``origin == "builtin"`` or the INDEX-declared author — snapshotted
      into ``_index_author`` by ``list_registry`` before the manifest merge
      — names us after ``_fold_author`` (see ``FIRST_PARTY_AUTHORS``). The
      badge asserts first-party
      provenance next to an Install button that runs setup code with
      gateway privileges, so it is never awardable from index-published
      trust keys or from the repo-fetched ``app.json``: a third-party core
      repo publishing ``"author": "kirocrew"`` in its manifest does not
      mint it (the merged ``author`` display field is deliberately NOT
      consulted).
    - ``featured``: dropped entirely from external rows so an external index
      can never self-flag into the Discover spotlight, regardless of client
      logic. Core-entry ``featured`` flags are preserved.
    - ``origin``: on external rows, any value other than the server-stamped
      ``"external"`` is dropped, so the wire never carries an ``origin`` that
      contradicts ``provenance: "external"`` — neither an index-published one
      nor one cross-stamped from an installed same-named app.
    - ``trustRepository``: the normalized clone target the server resolved for
      the app. It is OVERWRITTEN here, never copied from index or manifest
      content, because the consent modal sends it back as proof of what the
      operator reviewed. ``trust_repositories`` lets the catalog storefront
      supply coordinates resolved separately from its display-only rows.

    not exist on the ref the operator asked for (e.g. a pre-merge entry
    declaring ``main``); honouring it makes install clone a ref where the
    app's subdirectory is missing. The declared value is index-controlled
    (untrusted) content, while ``reg.branch`` already passed the branch regex
    gate before the fetch, so the override also narrows what a registry index
    can make the installer clone.

    A cross-repo entry — one whose effective clone URL differs from the

    in ANOTHER repository, about which ``reg.branch`` carries no information.
    The comparison is byte-identical string equality, matching the

    was unavailable, and the caller falls back to ``list_registry`` offline.

    see :func:`anonymous_git_env`). When ``False`` (the default: a bundled /

    identity via :func:`minimal_env`. When ``True`` (the repo URL came from an
    owner-configured *external* registry index — index-controlled content, not a
    repo the owner typed) the clone runs **credential-free** via
    :func:`anonymous_git_env` and forces the ``strict`` OS sandbox (``~/.ssh``
    hidden), so a hostile index entry pointing at a private *sibling* repo on the
    owner's own trusted forge cannot be read with the gateway's identity.

    The prefetch prefers the local checkout, so a checkout left sitting at a
    rejected state makes every retry re-reject at prefetch before it could
    ever pull a fixed remote — a permanently stuck app.

    A checkout created THIS RUN is deleted (no residue) and, when the run
    replaced a moved-aside previous checkout (*restore_from*), that previous
    checkout is renamed back into the slot — otherwise the rejection would
    leave the slot empty and strand the user's old workspace as a
    sweeper-doomed ``.stale-*`` sibling.

    A pre-existing workspace is rolled back to its pre-pull commit with
    ``git reset --keep`` (preserves uncommitted local edits; aborts on
    conflict), then the manifest is restored to its exact pre-update
    working-tree bytes (*manifest_snapshot*) — undoing whatever the pull,
    build, or ``onInstall`` script did to ``app.json`` WITHOUT discarding the
    user's own uncommitted manifest edits. Only when no snapshot exists does
    it fall back to ``git --literal-pathspecs checkout --`` from HEAD
    (literal pathspecs keep an index-controlled subdirectory from being
    parsed as pathspec magic). Best-effort throughout: a cleanup failure is
    logged, never raised — the refusal it follows must stand regardless.

    *manifest_relpath* is the untrusted registry-declared manifest path the
    caller built (``f"{subdirectory}/app.json"``, or plain ``app.json`` when
    no subdirectory was declared). A build step or ``onInstall`` script runs
    with write access to the checkout BEFORE some callers reach this cleanup,
    and can plant a symlink at the manifest path — the subdirectory OR the
    leaf — after an earlier containment check already passed; this restore
    then runs unsandboxed as the Kiro Crew process, so it must not trust that
    earlier check. Containment of the FULL manifest path is re-verified HERE,
    at the point of the write, against the CURRENT on-disk state: on a
    failure the manifest restore (both the raw-write and the git-checkout
    fallback) is skipped so neither can be redirected outside *pkg_dir*
    through a symlink planted after the caller's check. The pre-pull
    ``git reset`` above is unaffected — it targets the whole checkout, not
    the manifest path.

      durable_success`` so the flag is derived once, never hand-mirrored.
    - the exception handler in :func:`_clone_build_app` (the ``except`` that
      re-raises a build error). That path produces NO result dict — the
      exception propagates instead of returning — so the ``finally`` above
      never sees the move-aside state. This second call synthesises a minimal
      dict from that scope's ``pending_cleanup``/``restorable_stale`` and
      passes ``filter_restorable=True`` (the handler restored the same-origin
      subset just above it), so a non-restorable ``.stale-*`` on the
      exception path is still named instead of being silently swept.

    Both routes funnel the wording through here precisely so they can never
    drift: hand-replicating the reporter across every exit, with a
    ``filter_restorable`` flag manually mirrored to ``durable_success`` at each
    one, is the scattered-per-exit stranding class the caller's move-aside
    bookkeeping exists to avoid — a new exit could forget the call or pass the
    wrong flag and silently strand or double-report a checkout. Every normal
    exit reaches the single ``finally`` call and derives the flag once; the only
    other caller is the exception path that no ``finally`` return can cover.

    ``_pending_stale_cleanup`` collects every move-aside regardless of
    reason, but ``_restorable_stale`` (a subset) is put back by the
    enclosing ``finally`` — and ONLY when the exit leaves ``durable_success``
    False. The single call passes ``filter_restorable=not durable_success``,
    exactly the restore condition, so the flag can never drift from it:

    - On a failure exit (``durable_success`` False) the ``finally`` restored
      the restorable stale just before this call, so ``filter_restorable`` is
      True and that path — now back in place on disk — is filtered out rather
      than misreported as retained.
    - On a durable-success exit (``durable_success`` True) the ``finally``
      restores nothing, so ``filter_restorable`` is False and a restorable
      stale genuinely retained at ``.stale-*`` is reported instead of sitting
      unlogged until the age-based sweep — the possible-data-loss case this
      covers. A durable-success exit includes one where provenance
      persistence raised AFTER ``durable_success`` was set: the generic
      ``except`` catches it, the ``finally`` still sees ``durable_success``
      True, and this reporter names the retained stale.
