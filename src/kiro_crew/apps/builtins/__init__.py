    # dashboards. Dropping it from BUILTIN_NAMES stops it being REGISTERED, but an
    # install that already has it keeps the directory and its installed.json
    # entry -- leaving an App Store card for an app with no manifest behind it,
    # present enough to show and not present enough to open. Both spellings are
    # listed because the installed directory name is hyphenated while the Python
    # module was not, and an install can carry either.
