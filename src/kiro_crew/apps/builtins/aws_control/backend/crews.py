"""Remote crews — the deployed-crew inventory behind the console's Crews pane.

A remote crew is a Kiro Crew gateway the owner deployed into their OWN AWS account:
one CloudFormation stack per crew, with one ECS service inside it. How a deployed
crew is reached belongs to the deploy path, and nothing below reads it. This module
answers what exists and what state it is in. It creates nothing.

Two vocabulary notes, because the word is overloaded in this codebase:

* On the Agents page a "crew" is a LOCAL agent, and its card component is called
  ``CrewCard``. The UI here says "remote crews" for that reason.
* ``kirocrew-drive-*`` buckets belong to the personal cloud drive and are
  unrelated. A crew's own bucket is ``smc-<account>-<region>``.

Everything routes through :func:`kiro_crew.deploy.engine.run_aws`, the AWS CLI
subprocess chokepoint, exactly as the drive does. No boto3.

**The account binding is asserted, not assumed.** ``profile`` is a name resolved by
a child CLI process, so a profile repointed from account A to account B would have
this module report B's crews under a request for A. The ROUTE therefore re-derives
the account from ``sts get-caller-identity`` through the SAME profile before calling
in here, and refuses when it disagrees with the account the caller verified. The
functions below deliberately do not repeat that probe: it answers a question about
the caller, which the route has already settled, and asking again would spend a
further CLI process to re-derive the same answer. That is the drive's posture (see
``storage.find_drive``) applied to a read-only surface, because the consequence here
is disclosure rather than a misdirected write.
