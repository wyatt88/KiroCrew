"""HTTP routes for the AWS Control builtin, served in-process by the gateway.

Mounted at ``/api/apps/aws-control/`` — the same single-argument
``register_routes(app)`` convention every builtin uses (registered at startup
by the ``BUILTIN_NAMES`` loop; every handler carries its own enabled check).

Surface (owner-only throughout, see below):

READS
``GET /accounts``                              aggregated account list (?refresh=1)
``GET /profiles/available``                    local profiles, with registered flags
``GET /profiles/{name}/reconnect-plan``        what Reconnect can offer, no action
``GET /drive/{account}``                       drive presence + cached usage
``GET /drive/{account}/list``                  one listing page (?section&path&token)
``GET /drive/{account}/download``              short-lived download URL (?section&key)
``GET /drive/{account}/preview``               first bytes of a text file (?section&key)
``GET /drive/{account}/search``                filename search in a section (?section&q)
``GET /costs/{account}``                       cached bill (?refresh=1 re-queries CE)
``GET /library/{account}``                     local artifacts + reconciled push state
``GET /backup/{account}``                      backup state + remote archive listing
``GET /shares``                                live share ledger, objects checked (?account=)
``GET /iam-policy``                            drive-tier policy JSON (local render)

MUTATIONS (also restricted-session refused + SEL-audited)
``POST /profiles/register``                    add local profiles to the registry
``POST /profiles/unregister``                  drop profiles from the registry only
``POST /drive/{account}/bootstrap``            create the bucket (two-call confirm)
``POST /drive/{account}/upload``               upload one file (?section&key, raw body)
``POST /drive/{account}/delete``               delete one object
``POST /drive/{account}/move``                 move one object (drive section only)
``POST /drive/{account}/folder``               create an empty folder (placeholder)
``POST /drive/{account}/folder/delete``        delete a folder and all its objects
``POST /drive/{account}/share``                mint a presigned share + ledger entry
``POST /shares/{id}/forget``                   drop a ledger entry (link lives to expiry)
``POST /library/{account}/push``               push one artifact to the cloud library
``POST /library/{account}/remove``             delete a cloud copy + forget its record
``POST /backup/{account}/run``                 run a backup (snapshot | sessions)
``POST /backup/{account}/nightly``             toggle the nightly snapshot
``POST /backup/{account}/restore``             download an archive to the staging dir

GUARDS, in order, and why each exists:

1. **Enabled check** — a disabled app answers 403 ``app_disabled`` to
   everyone, so a probe cannot tell "app off" from "not for you".
2. **Owner-only, INCLUDING reads.** Account ids and caller ARNs are what the
   keystone-fenced consent leaf is fenced FROM; a surface printing them for
   any authenticated app token would hand out through one door what is
   locked behind another. ``is_owner_dashboard_request`` encodes the rule
   (same as ``aws_consent`` and ``mcp_apps``).
3. **Consent** — every handler that reaches AWS calls
   ``aws_consent.refuse_and_log`` (``s3`` or ``ce``) with the profile+region
   it is about to use. Fails closed; the page renders the consent card.
4. **Restricted-session refusal + SEL audit** on every mutation, matching
   the deploy handlers' discipline.
5. **Two-call confirm on billable resource creation** (bucket bootstrap):
   the first call returns a preview, only ``{"confirm": true}`` executes.
   There is no agent path to these endpoints at all (guard 2), so the
   dashboard click IS the human confirmation the spec's G1 requires.

#: be stale; the identity of the bucket we write to cannot.
#: Serializes drive creation (see _handle_drive_bootstrap). LoopBoundLock so
#: the module global never binds an import-time loop (#4800).
#: How long the RENDER path waits for the Library lock before giving up on the
#: reconcile. The lock is also held across a push, whose upload allows up to 600s,
#: so waiting on it unbounded would let one large push hang every Library page
#: render for the length of that upload. Errors on this path already degrade to
#: `reconciled: false`; slowness has to degrade the same way or the degradation is
#: only half real. Skipping costs nothing durable -- the reconcile is
#: self-correcting, so the next render does it.

#: Serializes the Library's own operations on one drive: a push, a removal, and
#: the reconcile that repairs the ledger. Each is a network round trip followed
#: by a ledger write, and interleaving two of them corrupts state that neither
#: half can detect on its own -- a push completing between the reconcile's
#: listing and its prune has its fresh record deleted, and a push racing a
#: removal of the same slug can leave one uploaded object behind the delete
#: sweep. The ledger's own file lock cannot serialize these: it deliberately
#: covers a sub-second read plus rename, and stretching it across S3 would make
#: a concurrent caller fail closed on Windows.
#:
#: Coarse on purpose -- one lock, not one per slug. This is an owner-only
#: surface where a human clicks buttons, so the contention is theoretical, and a
#: per-slug map would need eviction to stay bounded. LoopBoundLock for the same
#: reason ``_bootstrap_lock`` uses it: a module global must not bind an
#: import-time loop (#4800).
_library_lock = LoopBoundLock()

#: Per-object-key write locks for the drive surface. A move promises "never
#: silently overwrites", but S3's ``CopyObject`` carries no destination
#: precondition (``If-None-Match`` covers ``PutObject``, not the copy), so the
#: destination probe and the copy are separate requests — an upload landing
#: between them would be overwritten and the source then deleted. This gateway
#: is the drive's only product-plane writer, so serializing its own writers
#: per key closes that window for every write the product can make; writers
#: outside the gateway (the CLI drawer deliberately hands out the bucket name)
#: were never inside the promise. Per KEY, not one coarse lock like
#: ``_library_lock``: an upload legally holds its lock for the length of a
#: 512 MB put (up to 600 s), and a coarse lock would stall every unrelated
#: move behind it. Boundedness comes from refcounting instead of eviction —
#: an entry exists only while some request holds or awaits it, so the maps'
#: size is capped by in-flight requests, never by history.

    against. A LIVE identity probe re-verifies that the chosen profile still
    resolves to the REQUESTED account, and a mismatch refuses rather than
    executing against whatever the profile now points at.

    ``use_cache=False`` is the whole point of the probe here and is NOT a cost
    oversight. :func:`aws_consent.probe_identity` memoises per
    ``(profile, region)`` for 30 seconds, which is right for the consent and

    authorization decision: a cached answer of account A, honoured for a full
    30 seconds after the profile was repointed to B, verifies A while the read
    that follows runs against B's live credentials. Switching a profile between
    accounts is an ordinary operator action, not an extreme one, so that window
    is reachable in normal use. An authorization check that may answer from
    memory is not a check.

    What this buys and what it does not: the probe and the read are still two
    operations, so a repoint landing between them is not caught by anything
    here. That window is one call wide instead of thirty seconds, which is the
    difference between a race and a TTL, and closing it entirely would need an
    atomicity the AWS CLI does not offer.

    Takes the id rather than the request because ``GET /shares`` scopes by

    The section is restricted to ``drive`` by design: ``library`` and

    that state. A known-but-refused section answers the same 400 an unknown
    one does.

    Both keys pass the shared :func:`storage_mod.validate_key` BEFORE any AWS
    call, the source must exist (404), and the destination must NOT (409) —
    a move never silently overwrites. A source with a LIVE share link is
    refused (409 ``share_active``): the presigned URL is bound to the old key
    and would 404 while the Access ledger still reports it live.

    Everything from the re-authorization through the source delete runs under
    :func:`_locked_drive_write` for both keys — the coordination net every
    key-scoped drive mutation shares (upload, delete, folder create, the
    share mint) plus exclusion against folder sweeps — so within this gateway

    re-check runs first because the lock wait itself is a post-authorization
    gap. Writers outside the gateway are outside the promise. The source is
    deleted ONLY after the copy returned success, so a failed copy leaves the

    ``_require_drive`` ran and the AWS call they authorized. In that gap the app
    can be disabled, the profile can be repointed at another account, consent
    can be withdrawn, publish governance can start denying, or the drive tags
    can move to a different bucket -- and the call would then run on an
    authorization that no longer holds.

    ABOUT a profile and region, so verifying it against a stale pair proves
    nothing about where the bytes are going -- the identity has to be
    re-resolved first, and must still be the triple the request was authorized

    discovery can return a different bucket while the identity is unchanged. This

    """Start a backup and return its run id. Does NOT wait for it to finish.

    The work is a durable Job SDK run, so the fact that a backup is in flight
    lives on the server rather than in the browser tab that asked for it: a
    reload, a navigation away, or a second tab all still see it, and a run left
    behind by a gateway that died is resolved rather than advertised as running.
    The client follows the run on ``GET /backup/{account}``, whose ``jobs`` block
    is filtered to this account server-side. It does NOT read the app-scoped
    ``_jobs`` surface, which withholds ``dedupe_key`` and so cannot answer
    "is a backup running for THIS account".

    The pre-flight below stays, but its job has changed. It is no longer the
    authorization gate -- ``backup._authorize_upload`` is, inside the worker,
    immediately before the upload, and it holds for a run started through the
    generic ``_jobs`` surface too. What the pre-flight buys is a FAST, specific
    refusal: an unreconnected account, unconfirmed S3, or a missing drive answers
    409 with a code the UI can localise, instead of accepting the run and
    reporting the same thing thirty seconds later as a failed record.

    The terminal record is no longer in this response, because there is no
    terminal record yet. It reaches the client through ``GET /backup/{account}``,
    whose ``runs`` ledger the worker writes on success -- unchanged, and still
    the app's own record of what a backup PRODUCED (key, size, when). The Job SDK
    holds only that a run existed and how it ended.
