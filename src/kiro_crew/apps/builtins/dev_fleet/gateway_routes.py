"""Dev Fleet's in-gateway routes: the live-target cutover and its pointer-state broker.

Why these run in the GATEWAY process and not in the Dev Fleet backend
=====================================================================

``live_target.json`` names the checkout the gateway ``execve``s into at its next
start, so it is bind-masked from every sandboxed process. The Dev Fleet backend is
one of those processes — and so is everything it spawns: a nested sandbox is denied
by design, so its ``npm ci`` / build children run inside the SAME namespace. A leaf
the backend could write, a worktree's lifecycle script could write too. Carving the
pointer out for that backend (the first version of this fix) therefore handed a
routine build the power to choose the gateway's next image.

The gateway already owns the pointer (it is the process that reads it at boot), and
it already authenticates the dashboard owner's browser. So the cutover runs here,
authorised by the OWNER'S OWN REQUEST — never by a credential the backend holds,
because the backend's build children can read ``/proc/<pid>/environ`` and every
file in its namespace, so any such credential would be theirs as well.

Three routes, all under ``/api/apps/dev-fleet/`` (the in-gateway namespace; the
sandboxed backend is reverse-proxied at ``/apps/dev-fleet/api/``):

``POST make-live``
    The cutover / staged-cancel, unchanged in behaviour from when it lived in the
    backend (``live._make_live``). OWNER-ONLY, and REFUSED for any app principal —
    including Dev Fleet's own app token, which is exactly the credential a build
    child could steal.
``POST restart-gateway``
    Same gate. It shares the ``_MAKE_LIVE_LOCK`` / ``_MAKE_LIVE_COMMITTED`` latch
    with the cutover, so the two must live in one process.
``GET live-target``
    The pointer-state read broker: ``{live, staged, staged_cancel_available}`` as
    :class:`live.PointerState`. Open to any dashboard user AND to Dev Fleet's own app
    token — this is how the sandboxed backend learns which row is live or staged
    (``server.main`` installs :class:`pointer_broker.GatewayPointerBroker`). A
    stolen dev-fleet token buys a build child the path of the running checkout,
    which ``sys.executable`` and the systemd drop-in in ``~/.config`` already tell
    it; it buys no write. Any OTHER app's token is refused.
``POST`` / ``PUT`` / ``DELETE live-target/removal-lease``
    The removal lease the backend holds across ``git worktree remove`` (see
    ``live.removal_lease``): gateway-held state that excludes a cutover or a
    gateway restart from landing mid-deletion. Same principals as the read, but
    the lease itself is a CAPABILITY: ``POST {path}`` returns an unguessable token,
    and ``PUT {token}`` (heartbeat) / ``DELETE {token}`` require it — the shared app
    credential alone cannot cancel another operation's lease. A forged or
    forgotten lease can only DELAY a cutover, and it expires unless renewed.

Registered at gateway startup by the ``BUILTIN_NAMES`` loop in
``dashboard/routes/system.py`` (``_mod.register_routes(app)``), so every handler
checks the app's enabled state itself, like every other builtin.
