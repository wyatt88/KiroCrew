"""Dev Fleet — standalone aiohttp backend for KiroCrew feature worktrees.

Manages KiroCrew feature worktrees (git worktrees of the main repo) and their
isolated pod test instances. Runs as a subprocess spawned by the KiroCrew app
backend system (apps/backend.py). The gateway proxies /apps/dev-fleet/api/* to
this process with X-KiroCrew-Proxy HMAC signing; HMAC middleware validates
every request (except /health) fail-closed.

Routes (as seen by the backend after prefix stripping by gateway):
  GET  /api/fleet             -> lightweight worktree + pod list (polled)
  GET  /api/worktree?name=    -> lazy per-branch detail (pr/commits/disk)
  GET  /api/pod/logs?name=&n=
  GET  /api/run?id=           -> async run status + streamed output
  GET  /api/prune-candidates
  GET  /api/prune-status
  GET  /api/disk
  POST /api/sync              -> pull main + rebuild
  POST /api/worktree/remove {name, force?, discard_untracked_paths?}
  POST /api/prune-run {names, force_names?, discard_untracked_paths?}
  POST /api/pod/up   {name}
  POST /api/pod/down {name}
  POST /api/pod/restart {name}
  POST /api/pod/token {name}
  POST /api/pod/provision {name}  -> start async build, returns {run_id}
  POST /api/rebase  {name}
  POST /api/make-live {path, dry_run?}  -> repoint the live gateway at a worktree
  GET  /api/health            -> {"status": "ok", "start_id": ...}  (restart handshake; proxied)
  GET  /health                -> same body, HMAC-exempt (gateway-internal liveness poll only)
