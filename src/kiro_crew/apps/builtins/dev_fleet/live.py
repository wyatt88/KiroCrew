"""Gateway restart and make-live orchestration for Dev Fleet.

Two processes share this module, and the split between them is the security
boundary this module exists to respect:

* The **gateway process** owns the live-target pointer (``service/live_target.py``).
  ``_make_live`` and ``_restart_gateway`` run THERE, behind Dev Fleet's in-gateway
  routes (``gateway_routes.py``), authorised by the dashboard owner's own request.
* The **sandboxed backend** (``server.py``) never touches the pointer file: the OS
  mask over ``live_target.json`` applies to it and to every child it spawns — a
  worktree's ``npm ci`` lifecycle scripts run in the backend's namespace, so any
  file the backend could write, a checkout under build could write too. The
  backend READS pointer state through the gateway instead, via the provider
  installed by :func:`install_pointer_provider`.

Every pointer-derived read the BACKEND makes (``_live_worktree_path``,
``_staged_target_resolved``, ``_staged_cancel_available``) therefore goes through
the provider when one is installed, and answers locally otherwise. ``_staged_target``
itself stays the gateway's synchronous file read: ``_make_live`` — which refuses to
run under a provider at all — uses it under its lock.

# --- cutover / removal exclusion across the two processes ---
#: ``_MAKE_LIVE_LOCK`` below is an asyncio lock and so serialises only within one
#: process. Since the cutover runs in the gateway and a worktree removal runs in the
#: backend, the TOCTOU a single lock closes ("stage this worktree between the removal's
#: live-check and its ``git worktree remove``", and "restart the gateway — tree-killing
#: the backend — mid-removal") needs exclusion both processes see.
#:
#: NOT a lock file. A file in the crew data home is replaceable by any same-uid process
#: in the backend's namespace (its build children included): unlink-and-recreate the leaf
#: while one side holds the old inode and the other side locks the new one, and the two
#: stop excluding each other. The state lives in the GATEWAY's memory instead — the
#: process that already owns the cutover — as REMOVAL LEASES.
#:
#: A lease is a CAPABILITY, not a path claim: acquisition returns an unguessable token,
#: and renewal and release must present it. The Dev Fleet app credential the backend
#: uses to reach the gateway is readable by the build children in its namespace, so a
#: path-only release would let any of them cancel a removal's lease from under it; the
#: token is minted by the gateway and travels only in the lease reply, so a child that
#: never saw it cannot forge a release. It can still ACQUIRE leases of its own — and so
#: delay a cutover or a restart, which the same child could already cause by running
#: ``git worktree remove`` itself — so the exposure it keeps is delay, not escalation.
#:
#: A lease is short-lived and RENEWED by its holder for as long as the removal runs
#: (``removal_lease`` heartbeats at a third of the TTL, through ``_GIT_MUTATION_LOCK``
#: queueing and the ``git worktree remove`` itself); a forgotten lease therefore expires
#: on its own, while a live one never lapses mid-removal. The gateway refuses a NEW lease
#: while a cutover is in flight, and ``_make_live`` / ``_restart_gateway`` refuse ``busy``
#: while any lease is live.

_REMOVAL_LEASE_RENEW_SECS = _REMOVAL_LEASE_TTL_SECS / 3
#: How long a LAPSED lease (expired without release) keeps blocking cutovers and restarts.
#: A lease lapses only when its holder stopped heartbeating — the backend died, or the
#: gateway forgot it and refused renewal — and the holder may be inside its
#: uninterruptible ``git worktree remove`` (``worktree_ops``, 60 s timeout) with no way
#: to be told. Renewal is refused the moment the TTL passes (so a live holder learns the
#: lease is lost and never STARTS a new mutation), but the barrier itself outlives the
#: TTL by the mutation's timeout plus margin, so a mutation already under way cannot be
#: overlapped by a cutover or a restart. Only an explicit release ends it early.
