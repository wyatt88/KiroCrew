    ``_GIT_ENV_NEUTRALIZERS`` pins git transports to https/ssh and
    neutralizes repo-controlled execution config (fsmonitor/hooks/credential
    helper/sshCommand) for the sync ``git pull`` and any git a build step
    runs. Harmless for pip/npm.

    Operator credential helpers are injected ONLY when ``with_credentials`` is
    set — reserved for the network fetch step. Build steps (pip/npm) run
    worktree-controlled code and must never see a configured helper: a
    malicious install script could otherwise mint the operator's token via
    ``git credential fill``.

    ``with_credentials`` ALSO selects the PATH, and that is a security boundary,
    not a convenience:

    * credential-free (default) — the node toolchain dirs are PREPENDED to the
      trusted path. npm's own run-scripts (``tsc``, ``vite``) are
      ``#!/usr/bin/env node``, so ``node`` has to resolve by NAME inside the
      child; resolving only the ``npm`` argv would still fail at the first
      script. Those dirs live under ``$HOME`` because that is where
      ``ensure-node.sh`` installs node.
    * with credentials — the pinned ``_TRUSTED_PATH`` only. The fetch step's
      argv is an already-vetted absolute ``git``, but git looks its OWN helpers
      up (``git-remote-https``, credential helpers) on PATH, so a
      same-user-writable directory there would be a path to intercepting a
      credential-bearing fetch. Never widen this side.

    Scope of that guarantee, precisely: this ternary is what enforces it for the
    callers that spawn DIRECTLY (the ``raw_steps`` list, ``_pod_provision``,
    ``_start_run``). Callers that route through :func:`_run_cmd` are covered by
    a second, independent mechanism — ``_run_cmd`` overwrites PATH with
    ``_TRUSTED_PATH`` unconditionally, BEFORE it injects any credential helper —
    so on that path a node-augmented PATH from :func:`_pod_env` is discarded and
    never coexists with credentials. Both mechanisms must keep holding; do not
    remove one on the assumption that the other covers it.
