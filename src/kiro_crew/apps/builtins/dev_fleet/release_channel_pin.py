"""Release-channel worktree: one detached checkout pinned to the stable release.

Dev Fleet manages git checkouts, and a git checkout has no release channel —
``platform/update_capability.py`` says so outright: *"Only the wheel command
carries a channel. A git checkout follows its remote."* That is fine for the
install the user runs, and useless for the question this module answers: **what
did stable actually ship, and can I click through it right now?**

WHY A WORKTREE, AND NOT A PIN ON THE PRIMARY CHECKOUT. Sync
fast-forwards the primary checkout (``git merge --ff-only``) and refuses to run
unless HEAD is literally :data:`repository.BASE_BRANCH`. A stable tag is
normally BEHIND main, so pinning that checkout to a lane could only work by
detaching its HEAD (which the sync guard rejects, and every ``origin/main``
comparison on the fleet row is then measuring against a ref the user did not
choose) or by resetting ``main`` backwards, which destroys work. So the lane
gets its own detached worktree instead: additive, non-destructive, and it lands
in the fleet as an ordinary row that pods and Make Live already know how to
drive.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT. It never reads or writes ``$KIROCREW_HOME/channel``.
That file says which lane the user's real install FOLLOWS for updates; a pin
here says which git ref a worktree SITS ON. Coupling them would mean
materializing a stable worktree silently changed what the user's live install
downloads next — a blast radius nobody asked for. The only thing borrowed from
the update stack is vocabulary and validation.

Resolution is deliberately split from mutation, and the line is the WORKTREE:
nothing here moves a checkout, so the fleet snapshot can resolve the channel on
its refresh path without that risk. It is not ref-free -- :func:`fetch_refs`
writes remote-tracking refs and tags, which is exactly what makes a resolve
current -- but a ref update cannot strand a commit or change what a pod is
serving. The create mutation lives in ``worktree_ops``
beside the other worktree writers, because they take the same ``.git`` admin
lock those do.

#: The one release channel Dev Fleet materializes: the channel whose tip a git tag
#: actually names, and whose order among those tags is a fact rather than a rule
#: this feature would have to invent.
#:
#: ``nightly`` could not be it: ``nightly.yml`` builds from ``main`` HEAD on a
#: schedule and tags NOTHING, so the newest ref it could name is ``<remote>/main``
#: — which is main *now*, not the commit the last nightly published, and is where
#: the primary checkout already sits after Sync. A row promising "what nightly
#: shipped" that shows neither is worse than no row.
#:
#: ``insider`` is out by product decision, not by a missing fact — its
#: ``-insider.N`` tags do resolve. Ranking them is what has no answer: ordering
#: ``-insider.N`` against ``-rc.N`` needs a precedence between two prerelease
#: spellings that nothing in this repo states, so a prerelease channel's "tip"
#: would rest on a rule this feature invented.
#:
#: Singular on purpose. A tuple of channels, a channel parameter on every function
#: and a channel key in every request would all be shapes with one possible value,
#: and ``test_release_channel_is_a_real_channel`` pins that this name is still a
#: channel stack knows. A second channel is a change to this module's shape, made
#: when the ordering rule for prerelease tags exists to justify it.
CHANNEL = "stable"

#: A tag naming a stable release: ``v1.2.3`` and nothing after it.
_STABLE_TAG_RE = re.compile(r"^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$")

#: Where the remote's release tags are mirrored, and the ONLY place the channel
#: resolves from.
#:
#: ``refs/tags/`` cannot be that place. It is a shared namespace an operator writes
#: to as well: a locally cut release candidate, a bisect marker, a ``v99.0.0``
#: someone tagged to test an upgrade path. Every one of those matches
#: :data:`_STABLE_TAG_RE`, sorts newest, and would become the channel "tip" —
#: so the row would badge an unpublished commit as a shipped release and Create
#: would check it out. Nothing about a local tag distinguishes it from a fetched
#: one after the fact, so the separation has to happen when the ref is written.
#:
#: A mirror the operator has no reason to write to makes "published" a property of
#: WHERE the ref is rather than a claim about how it got there -- but only because the
#: fetch PRUNES it (see :func:`fetch_refs`). Location alone would be a statement about
#: habit, not an enforced boundary: a ref namespace is writable by anything with access
#: to this repo, so an unpruned mirror can be forged with one ``git update-ref`` and the
#: forgery outranks every real release. Pruning is what makes the namespace hold what
#: the remote advertised and nothing else.
#:
#: Because the mirror is pruned, a release retracted upstream also stops resolving on
#: the next fetch, while ``refs/tags/`` stays additive for the operator's own use.
_TAG_NS = "refs/dev-fleet/release-tags"

#: The refspec that populates :data:`_TAG_NS`. Forced, because a re-pushed tag must
#: overwrite the mirror rather than being skipped as a non-fast-forward: the mirror
#: is a cache of the remote's answer, not history anyone builds on.
#:
#: Exported because two callers fetch for this channel — :func:`fetch_refs` before a
#: mutation, and the background refresher every cycle — and a refspec spelled twice
#: is a refspec that drifts. The one that drifted would fail silently: the channel
#: would resolve against a mirror that stopped being updated, which reads exactly
#: like a repo that has published nothing new.
_TAG_REFSPEC = f"+refs/tags/v*:{_TAG_NS}/v*"

#: The basename of the release-channel worktree.
#:
#: The basename becomes the fleet row label (``fleet_state`` uses ``Path(path).name``
#: verbatim) AND the pod identity (``kirocrew-pod@<name>.service``), so it is spelled
#: in full rather than abbreviated: ``release-channel-stable`` reads as what it is
#: next to a ``kirocrew-wt-<slug>`` feature worktree, and the missing
#: ``kirocrew-wt-`` prefix is what visually separates the two groups with no extra
#: chrome.
#:
#: Deliberately NOT ``channel-`` — bare "channel" already means four unrelated
#: things in this codebase (agent channels in ``kiro_crew/channel.py``, messaging
#: channels, notification channels, upload document channels).
#:
#: One literal, not a prefix composed with :data:`CHANNEL`. That composition had
#: exactly one consumer -- this line -- so it was generality for a second channel
#: that is not shipping, and it made the name that every other surface matches on
#: (the row, the pod identity, the reserved-name guard) something a reader had to
#: assemble.

    Returns ``None`` on success, else the error to report. Called before every
    resolve that must be current, so a mutation acts on the channel's real tip
    rather than on whatever the mirror held a cycle ago. The background refresher
    fetches the same things every cycle, which is what keeps the fleet ROWS
    honest between mutations; this call is what makes a Create honest at the moment
    it runs.

    ``--tags`` is kept beside :data:`_TAG_REFSPEC` rather than replaced by it, but the
    two run as SEPARATE fetches because only one of them is load-bearing. The refspec
    populates the private mirror the channel resolves from and its failure is fatal;
    ``--tags`` keeps ``refs/tags/`` current for the operator's own git — the reported
    ``ref`` is a real ``refs/tags/vX.Y.Z`` they can check out, and dropping it would
    leave newly published tags invisible to every ordinary command they run in this
    repo. The channel reads only the mirror, so a tag that reaches ``refs/tags/`` by
    any other route cannot become a tip.

    Splitting them is what keeps a benign local state from blocking the feature. The
    refspec is forced; ``--tags`` is not, so a local tag that diverged from the
    remote's tag of the same name makes git report
    ``! [rejected] vX.Y.Z -> vX.Y.Z (would clobber existing tag)`` and exit non-zero
    even when the mirror refspec succeeded. Reported as one status that would refuse
    every Create for an operator who ever cut a release-shaped tag of their own, so the
    courtesy fetch is best-effort and only the mirror fetch decides.

    **``--prune`` is what makes the mirror a fact rather than a habit, and it is
    load-bearing for two distinct jobs -- neither of which is Create's integrity.** A ref
    namespace is writable by anything with access to this repo -- an agent with git is
    exactly that -- so without pruning, a hand-written
    ``refs/dev-fleet/release-tags/v999.0.0`` outranks every real release by semver and
    survives every additive fetch. What that costs is, first, the FLEET ROWS: the display
    path resolves out of this same mirror and has no provenance backstop, so a forged ref
    is badged as the stable release there. Second, it costs Create's AVAILABILITY: the
    forgery is picked by every resolve and refused by every provenance check, so Create
    stays refused until someone hand-runs ``git update-ref -d``. Create's INTEGRITY is
    owned by :func:`advertised_release_commits`, which asks the configured upstream what it
    publishes and refuses any other oid, so a forged mirror ref cannot reach a checkout
    whether or not the fetch pruned. Pruning deletes any mirror ref the remote does not
    advertise, so the namespace holds what the remote published and nothing else.

    ``--prune`` is NOT ``--prune-tags``, and conflating the two is what left this open.
    Pruning is scoped to the DESTINATIONS of the refspecs actually given, which
    ``git-fetch(1)`` states directly: a tag fetched only via ``--tags`` is not subject to
    pruning, while the destination of an explicit refspec is. The split makes that
    scoping structural rather than argued — the pruning fetch names the mirror refspec
    and the base branch and never mentions tags at all, so it deletes a forged mirror
    ref and a tag the remote retracted, and ``refs/tags/`` is not among its destinations
    for a LOCAL-ONLY tag the operator authored to be reachable by. It is ``--prune-tags``
    that contributes an implicit ``+refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*`` and destroys the operator's
    own tags -- that flag is still refused, and its absence is asserted by a test. A stale
    remote-tracking branch is likewise left alone. This follows from the documented
    scoping rule rather than from one version's behaviour, and ``--prune-tags`` is the
    opt-in shorthand git 2.17 ADDED, so no older git prunes ``refs/tags/`` more eagerly
    than this.

    So retraction is handled here rather than deferred: the channel stops resolving a
    yanked release on the next fetch, while ``refs/tags/`` stays additive so the
    operator can still see and check out a tag locally after upstream drops it.

    Checking a tag out runs whatever ``filter.<name>.process``/``.smudge``/``.clean``
    driver applies to the files it writes, and that driver is an arbitrary command.
    The key space is unbounded -- ``<name>`` is attacker-chosen -- so

    ``core.hooksPath``/``core.fsmonitor``/``credential.helper`` keys. Hence a
    refusal rather than a neutralizer, following
    ``dashboard/handlers/worktree.py::_checkout_filter``.

    WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT COME FROM. A driver is only ever defined in a config
    FILE. ``.gitattributes`` can *name* a filter for a path but cannot say what it
    runs, and a fetch carries refs and objects, never config -- so the release being
    checked out cannot introduce one, and a tag that names a filter with no driver
    defined is inert. What this probe therefore refuses is a declaration already
    present in THIS checkout's own config, which is the case worth refusing: that
    config is writable by anything with the agent's filesystem access.

    SCOPES. ``--local`` (``.git/config``), plus ``--worktree``
    (``config.worktree``) when ``extensions.worktreeConfig`` makes that scope live.
    ``--includes`` is mandatory on both: for a specific-scope query git defaults
    include-following OFF, so a driver reached through ``include.path`` resolves at
    checkout time while staying invisible to a probe without it. Global and system
    config are deliberately NOT probed -- that is the operator's own machine
    (``git lfs install`` writes ``filter.lfs.*`` there), not something a repository
    supplies, and refusing it would break every host with git-lfs installed.

    FILTERS ONLY, not merge drivers. This module's one mutation checks a tag out and
    never merges, so a ``merge.<name>.driver`` has no path to execution here; the
    sibling that does merge (``md_notebook/git_ops.py::repo_supplied_driver``) covers
    both because both apply to it.

    Fails CLOSED: a probe that errors returns a refusal, because an unread scope is
    not a clean one.

    Every read here runs at the ``strict`` tier, which is load-bearing rather than
    tidy. ``--includes`` exists precisely so the probe FOLLOWS repository-controlled
    ``include.path``, so these are the calls most exposed to config this checkout does
    not author -- and they need no network, so they need no credentials. The standard
    tier would hand them the gateway's trusted credential helpers for nothing.
    :func:`fetch_refs` and :func:`advertised_release_commits` stay standard because

    already run, and ranks first if its version is high enough. This asks the upstream
    remote what it publishes, so "published" is a verified fact about that remote rather
    than an inference from where a local ref sits.

    The remote is the one named in this repository's own git config, and its URL is read
