"""The sandboxed Dev Fleet backend's client for the gateway's pointer-state broker.

The backend cannot read ``live_target.json`` — the file is bind-masked in its
namespace, and that mask is deliberate (see ``gateway_routes.py``). What it needs
from the pointer is three facts for the fleet view and the removal guards: which
checkout is live, which is staged, and whether a staged cutover can be cancelled.
The gateway answers those at ``GET /api/apps/dev-fleet/live-target``; this module
is the client, installed as :func:`live.install_pointer_provider` by ``server.main``.

Authentication is the App Kit exchange every app backend already has the material
for: ``KIROCREW_PROXY_SECRET`` (the same ``.app_secret`` the gateway signs proxied
requests with) is traded at ``POST /api/apps/dev-fleet/token`` for an app-scoped
token, which the token middleware stamps as ``request["app"] == "dev-fleet"``. That
principal is allowed to READ this one route and nothing that writes the pointer.

Failure is loud: :class:`live.PointerUnavailable`, never ``None``. ``None`` means
"nothing is live", and a removal that believed that during a broker outage would
delete the checkout a cutover is staged on. Callers choose how to degrade.
