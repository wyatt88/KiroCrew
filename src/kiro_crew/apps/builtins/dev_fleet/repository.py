    unapproved file loses that file, with ``-fd`` AND with a bare ``-f``, even

    now refers to a directory, so a type change is a refusal rather than a sweep.
    Having no pathspec at all also removes the pathspec-magic surface entirely.

    ancestor is refused; that is the same trade as the platform check below.

    the discard is REFUSED rather than downgraded to a path-based unlink, since a
    junction swapped into an ancestor is not even reported as a link by
    ``os.path.islink``. Empty directories are left behind on purpose -- git does
    not track them, ``status``/``ls-files`` do not report them, and ``git worktree

      staged, deleted, renamed or unmerged, False when none is, and ``None``
      when git could not answer — which callers must treat as unverifiable,
      never as clean.
    * ``untracked_paths`` are files git considers untracked and NOT ignored, so
      build output (``.venv``, ``node_modules``, anything in ``.gitignore``)
      never counts as dirt. An empty list means "none found OR git failed" — it
      is deliberately not a promise, and the discard path treats an empty list
      as "nothing approved to discard".

    Why two commands instead of parsing one ``--porcelain`` blob: ``-uno``
    suppresses untracked entries, so anything it prints is a tracked change and
    a plain non-empty test suffices; ``ls-files --others`` prints bare paths
    with no status columns to misparse.

    The untracked half deliberately bypasses the shared ``_git`` helper, which
    strips its output and would corrupt a first or last filename carrying
    leading or trailing whitespace. These paths are not merely displayed — they
    become the ``git clean`` pathspec deciding which files a discard destroys —
    so they must survive byte-exact. A corrupted path would simply fail to
    match and abort the removal, which is safe but is a refusal nobody earned.
