"""App manifest — static metadata for KiroCrew apps.

An app manifest (``app.json``) declares an app's identity, resources, and
requirements without executing any app code.  KiroCrew reads it during
install to register agents, skills, crons, UI pages, and backend config.

Design follows the same pattern as :class:`kiro_crew.plugins.manifest.PluginManifest`
(dataclass + ``from_dict`` / ``to_dict`` / ``validate`` / round-trip) but with
app-specific fields.

# sync with that table (they are duplicated rather than shared to avoid a

# in this module, tightening a name is a one-way door — it invalidates an app

    setting scoped to "this chat" has to be set on a separate page against an
    opaque session key the app cannot even discover.

    Rendered by the dashboard as a lazily-imported ESM module, exactly like a
    page, so the existing import map (react, the app SDK) and the single-React
    guarantee apply unchanged. The component is handed the active session's
    identity as props — that is the whole point of the slot.

    ``statusPath`` is optional and lets the chip carry state *before* it is
    opened. Without it a control can only report anything once its module is
    lazily imported, which is on first click — so a per-session setting looks
    unset until you go looking for it. The dashboard GETs
    ``<the app's own route base>/<statusPath>?session_key=…`` and reads
    ``{state, tooltip}``, where state is ``ok`` | ``warn`` | ``none``.

    That base depends on how the app serves its backend, because the two are
    mounted at different prefixes: an app with in-gateway hook routes answers
    under ``/api/apps/<app>/``, while an app running its own backend PROCESS is
    reverse-proxied at ``/apps/<app>/api/``. The dashboard picks the prefix from
    the manifest rather than trusting a declared one, so a control does not have
    to know which it is.

class CommandArgument:
    """The ONE value a contributed command collects before it can act.

    Deliberately singular. Raycast-style multi-argument tokens are a real feature,
    but every argument is another thing the reader must get right before a command
    that writes somewhere fires, and one value covers the cases this contribution
    point exists for (a link, a query, an identifier). A second argument is an
    additive change to this class, not a rewrite of it.

    The argument is checkable BEFORE the command runs -- the collected text is
    spliced into an instruction handed to an agent with tools, so "anything the
    reader pasted" is not an acceptable domain.

    ``kind`` names one of a FIXED set of matchers the host implements. It is
    deliberately not a regex, and that is the whole design of this field. An earlier
    revision let the manifest ship its own ``pattern``; a regex is a small program,
    and running a third party's program against the field on every keystroke, on the
    thread that draws the launcher, is a hang the reader cannot escape -- ``^(a+)+$``
    and ``^(a|aa)+$`` are both under ten characters and both exponential, and neither
    Python nor JavaScript can interrupt a synchronous match. Fencing that off with
    syntactic checks was attempted and abandoned: the checks can only ever recognize
    shapes, so each one invites the next hostile pattern that it does not cover.

    So the manifest DESCRIBES what it wants and the host decides how to check it.
    ``url`` parses with the runtime's own URL parser (linear, no backtracking) and
    then applies ``hosts``; ``text`` accepts any non-empty value. Both run in time
    proportional to the input no matter what the manifest says. Adding a kind is a
    change to this file -- which is exactly the point: the vocabulary is ours.

    The cost is precision, and it is a real cost. A pattern could demand
    ``/pull/<n>`` specifically; ``kind="url"`` with ``hosts=["github.com"]`` accepts
    any URL on that host and leaves what the link DENOTES to the agent reading it.
    That is the right split -- the host is the wrong place to encode another
    product's URL taxonomy, and it cannot do so safely.

            # one clause up, and for the same reason: vetting bounds the SHAPE of a
            # contribution, but only the signature authenticates PUBLISHER INTENT.

            # trust in the signature is precisely what would carry the tampered
            # prompt into a session.
            #
            # `argument` rides along inside each entry's canonical to_dict(), which
            # matters as much as the prompt: widening a matcher (`kind: url` with a
            # host allowlist -> `text`) does not change a single visible character of
            # the row, and it is what decides whether the value spliced into that

            # existed keep producing the identical payload -- and an app contributing
            # only commands produces the same bytes it did before panel tabs and file
            # menus existed.
            #
            # `panelTabs` is in the guard for a sharper version of the same reason: a
            # tab's `entry` names an ESM module the AppHost imports and RUNS in the
            # dashboard's own origin. Guarding on commands/sessionControls alone left a
            # panelTabs-ONLY manifest out of the payload entirely, so its `entry` was
            # the one part of a signed app an attacker could repoint with the signature
            # still verifying.
            #
            # A contributed file-menu row is covered for the same reason at one remove:
            # its `endpoint` is where the host POSTs the path of a file the reader picked,
            # so rewriting it on a signed app redirects that dispatch while every visible
            # character of the row, and the signature, stay exactly as published.
