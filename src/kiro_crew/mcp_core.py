    and the new port is recorded only in the run marker — so one re-resolution
    and one replay are worth it. Two conditions end the attempt instead, and both

    * the re-resolution fell through to the DEFAULT port, which is no evidence at

      unchanged dead port only doubles the caller's latency to reach the
      identical failure, and nothing was handed to a live gateway — so the

    "has the gateway MOVED, so is there a new base worth dialling"; this one
    answers "does re-resolution still positively identify the SAME base, so is
    re-dialling it still addressed to the gateway proved to own it".

    Why a same-base retry needs this at all: the ownership proof is per
    ATTEMPT, not per process (see :func:`_resolve_api_target`). A marker
    resolution is never pinned precisely because the gateway can exit and
    something else can take the port — and a retry that SLEEPS first is exactly
    that window. Re-dialling the cached pair would hand the internal secret and
    the session key to whatever now listens there, which is the same exposure
    the ``source == "default"`` rule above refuses, for the same reason.

    Three outcomes answer ``None``, so the caller stops instead of dialling:

    * the re-resolution fell through to the DEFAULT port — no evidence at all,
      so the listener could be any local process.
    * the re-resolution names a DIFFERENT base. The gateway moved mid-backoff,
      so the refused base is no longer owned and this retry is over. Chasing the
      new base is :func:`_replay_target`'s job on the caller's next attempt, not
      a second replay smuggled into a retry loop.
    * the port is not PROVEN to be held by this user's gateway. The source
      label alone cannot carry that proof: ``KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT`` is
      inherited process state naming the gateway that SPAWNED us, exported
      once its site was listening (``dashboard.server._export_bound_port``),
      and it ranks above the marker step — so ``bound``, not ``marker``, is
      the source for every gateway-spawned process, and it is never
      ownership-checked. A refusal is affirmative evidence the previous owner
      is gone, and a retry that SLEEPS first is exactly the window in which
      another local user can rebind the port, so the proof is re-earned here
      via :func:`port_is_gateway_owned` before the secret is dialled anywhere.
      A ``marker`` resolution already ran that proof inside its own step, so it
      is not re-run for one.

    Gating on the proof rather than on a list of trusted labels is deliberate.
    Trusting ``bound`` because it is "stable for the process lifetime" (which is
    what :data:`_STABLE_PORT_SOURCES` means, and all it means) confuses a value
    that does not change with a gateway that is still there; refusing it instead
    would have disabled this retry for the deployment it exists to serve, since
    ``bound`` is the only source that ever fires there. Verifying the port keeps
    the retry working when the gateway really did come back on it, and refuses
    only when something else answers.

    On non-POSIX the proof denies outright, so the retry is unavailable rather
    than approximated — the same trade :func:`_gateway_owns_port` already makes
    for marker discovery, and for the same reason: the file-permission argument
    that carries it does not hold there. ``--port`` / ``KIROCREW_PORT`` users on
    Windows get the actionable exhaustion message instead of a silent re-dial.

       file is agent-writable and therefore forgeable; the sidecar is
       signed with the SEL trust root (``sel_hmac.key``), which agents
       cannot read, and binds the pid into the MAC so another pid's

       tool redacts because LLM prose about an untrusted issue body is
       re-rendered on a card; here the same prose is ALSO rendered into a
       comment on the forge, so a credential or exfil URL quoted out of an issue
       would be published, not merely stored.
    2. ``_crew_machine_markers`` — redaction covers credentials and exfil URLs,
       NOT an absolute path or a host name, and those are exactly what must not
       leave this machine in a public comment. This pass is a backstop, not the
       control: it can only remove identifiers this process can name, so the
       crew brief's prohibition remains the primary rule. It is deliberately NOT
       applied to ``worktree`` / ``branch`` / ``base_sha`` — those are the one
