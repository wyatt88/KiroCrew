"""Named memory stores: the two roots, the shape rule, and the resolvers.

A crew (``cfg.agents[<crew>].memory_store``) names a memory store, and a store
is a SEPARATE on-disk silo: its own markdown tree, its own FTS index and its
own vector-store SQLite file. There is no workspace column and no cutover — isolation is the
file boundary.

**There are TWO roots, and conflating them is the sharpest hazard here.** The
resolvers below answer for the same store name, and they answer with different
paths:

* :func:`memory_store_dir_for` — the MARKDOWN root, the directory holding
  ``memory/preferences.md``, ``memory/projects.md`` and ``memory/history/*.md``.
  For ``"default"`` this is :func:`kiro_crew.memory.workspace_dir`
  (``config_dir()/"workspace"``), NOT the data home: returning the data home
  would move every existing install's markdown memory out from under both the
  consolidator and ``kirocrew memory search``.
* :func:`resolve_store_path` — the VECTOR FILE. For ``"default"`` this is
  ``config_dir()/"memory.db"``, byte-identical to the path
  ``VectorMemoryStore()`` already defaults to.

:func:`memory_index_path_for` answers a third question and does NOT follow the
markdown root: the DEFAULT store's FTS index stays in the data-home root, beside
``memory.db``, because that is the location the snapshot ``memory`` component,
``portability``'s export zip and ``scripts/sync-to-remote.sh`` name for it. A
NAMED store's index does live inside its own directory, and the first two of
those consumers carry the whole ``memory_stores/`` tree (minus the host-local
entries :func:`is_host_local_store_state` names).

Nothing here moves data. A named store starts EMPTY; nothing is copied or
inferred from the default store.

A supplied named store is resolved exactly or raises UnknownMemoryStore. Existing
members retain their declared V1 binding until the owner selects private V2.
New members receive an empty owned V2 store. Private ownership is recorded in
config, the bounded member-memory.json manifest and the database.

LEAF module: stdlib-only imports at module scope, so ``security.py`` (imported
very early, and which needs :data:`MEMORY_STORES_DIR_NAME` to build its
sensitive-path fence) can depend on it without a cycle. Everything else is
imported inside the function that needs it.

    The member-id migration (``config.loader.MIGRATE_MEMBER_IDS``) re-keys an
    ``agents`` row and its ``memory_stores[...].owner_member`` inside
    ``config.json``; this is the filesystem half. Ownership is asserted from
    THREE places that must agree — the config record, the store's manifest and
    the ``memory_meta`` owner row inside the database — so a row re-keyed
    without this step reads as an ownership mismatch and the member's memory
    is refused. Each place is rewritten only when it still names *old*; a
    manifest or database already naming *new* (a retried migration) is left
    alone, and one naming a THIRD member is not touched — that is someone
    else's store, and the config mismatch it leaves is the correct verdict.

    Raises :class:`UnknownMemoryStore` for a store name outside the grammar;
    lets ``OSError``/``sqlite3.Error`` propagate so the caller's locked
    write-back aborts and the next load retries the whole migration. Never
    waits on a lock (see the connect below): the caller may be on the event
    loop, and a busy database is a reason to retry later, not to stall.

    The DATABASE is renamed first and the manifest second, and a manifest
    write that fails puts the database row back: the database is the step
    that fails in ordinary operation (a live session holds it), so it must
    fail before anything has changed. The other order left the manifest
    renamed and the database not, and the retry is not guaranteed to mint the
    same id -- a collision landing in between shifts the suffix -- so a
    half-renamed store could be split for good.

    Both writes happen while the store's LIFETIME lock is held shared -- the
    lock every open store holds and a snapshot restore takes exclusively to
    swap the directory (``member_memory_backup.hold_stores_for_replace``). A
    replace cannot land between the two writes, and a replace in progress
    makes the acquisition fail at once (no wait, same reason as the database
    connect) so the pass aborts with nothing renamed and the next load
    retries against whatever the replace put there.
