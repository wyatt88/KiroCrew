"""Crew-member identity: the split between a member's ``id`` and its ``display_name``.

A crew member is a Kiro custom agent plus a Kiro Crew wrapper (the ``agents`` row
in ``config.json`` and ``members/<id>/``). Before this module the row's KEY did
two jobs at once — it was the primary key every subsystem references (member
dir, DM binding, slot ``agent``, cron ``agent``, governance identity) AND the
label the user typed and reads. The two roles have incompatible rules: the
create flow accepted ``case competition`` (a space), and the Crew Members roster
silently filtered the row out because a key with a space cannot address anything.

The wrapper now separates them:

* ``id`` — the ``agents`` map key. System-minted, immutable, matches
  :data:`MEMBER_ID_RE` (the shared agent-name grammar). Also the member's Kiro
  custom-agent ``name``, so Kiro and Kiro Crew agree on identity.
* ``display_name`` — what the user calls the member. Free text, free rename,
  zero blast radius. Stored on the row; empty means "same as the id".

Every consumer that keyed on the name keeps working, because for a
well-formed name the minted id IS the name. Only a name outside the grammar
gets a sanitized id, with the original string preserved as its display name —
the split the user intended when typing it.

Leaf module on purpose: the config loader imports it during ``load()`` (the
migration), so it must not import from ``kiro_crew.config`` or anything that
does. The grammar is spelled here and pinned equal to
``kiro_crew.validation._AGENT_NAME_RE`` by a test rather than imported, because
``validation`` imports ``config.sections`` and would close a cycle.
