"""The live target: which checkout the gateway actually runs.

Dev Fleet's "Make live" repoints the running gateway at a feature worktree. The
target is recorded in a small pointer file here rather than in the service
definition, because every service manager makes its own definition expensive to
mutate in a different way:

* a systemd **system** unit (what ``kirocrew service install`` writes on Linux)
  lives under ``/etc/systemd/system`` and needs root to change;
* a launchd plist only re-reads on ``bootout`` + ``bootstrap``, and the
  ``bootout`` half kills the very process that would have to run the second
  half;
* a packaged desktop app spawns the backend with no definition we own at all.

The gateway consults the pointer during startup: when it names a different
checkout the process ``execve``s into that checkout's own ``kirocrew``, moving
the working directory and ``PATH`` with it. A cutover is therefore "write the
pointer, then restart", and staging needs no service manager at all.

This is the version-selector/launcher-proxy shape used by ``rustup`` (proxies
read ``rust-toolchain.toml``), the Go toolchain (``go`` reads the ``toolchain``
line in ``go.mod`` and execs that toolchain), and ``rbenv``/``pyenv`` shims. It
also inherits their headline failure mode: a proxy that resolves back to itself
execs forever. :func:`maybe_reexec` is hardened against that twice over — an
env marker that survives the exec, and a realpath comparison that refuses to
exec into the image already running.

Security posture — the pointer decides which code the gateway executes, so it is
a code-execution input:

* It is **keystone-fenced** (``security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``), so agent tools
  can neither read nor write it. Only a human-driven dashboard action writes it.
* It is **validated before use** (:func:`read_target`), not merely parsed.
* Resolution is **fail-safe, never fail-open**: any malformed, stale or
  unusable pointer is ignored and the currently-installed code boots. A bad
  pointer must not be able to leave the host with no gateway — the hazard a
  persisted bad systemd drop-in carries, since it re-applies on every
  subsequent restart.
