class _LazyShutdownEvent:
    """Proxy for ``asyncio.Event`` that defers construction until first use.

    On Python 3.9, ``asyncio.Event()`` captures the *current* event loop at
    construction time.  Creating it at module-import time binds it to
    whatever loop ``get_event_loop()`` implicitly returns (typically a
    throwaway loop created during import), which is NOT the loop that
    ``asyncio.run()`` later spins up for the gateway.  Awaiting such an
    Event from the gateway loop raises::

        RuntimeError: Task ... got Future ... attached to a different loop

    Python 3.10+ made ``asyncio.Event`` loop-less, but we still target 3.9.

    This proxy constructs the underlying Event lazily, **inside the running
    loop**, on first method access.  The real Event therefore binds to the
    correct loop.  The proxy also rebinds transparently if the running
    loop changes (tests, repeated ``asyncio.run()`` cycles).

    Why ``get_running_loop()`` and not ``get_event_loop()``:
        On Python 3.9 in the main thread, ``get_event_loop()`` never raises
        ``RuntimeError`` when no loop is running — it silently creates (or
        returns) a default loop.  Using it here would reintroduce the
        original cross-loop bug whenever the first access happens outside
        a running loop.  ``get_running_loop()`` raises cleanly when no
        loop is running, which is what we want so we can fall back to
        pending state without accidentally binding to a stray loop.

    For sync callers without a running loop (rare — in practice every
    caller in this codebase is inside an async context or signal handler
    registered on the running loop), we maintain a pending-set flag so
    the intent is preserved until a loop is available.
