"""Which ACP backends this build can serve — the one place that decides.

The question this module owns is **capability**: can this build drive the harness
at all? The public baseline registers kiro-cli, Claude Code, KAS and Codex; an
edition plugin adds its own from ``ProviderRegistry.register_acp_backends`` by calling
:func:`register_selectable_backend`, the structural twin of
``publish_provider.register_provider``.

A LEAF module on purpose. ``kiro_crew/acp/__init__.py`` imports the ACP client and
runtime, so reaching ``kiro_crew.acp.types`` executes that package init and lands
back in ``config.loader`` — a cycle ``_normalize_acp_backend`` can only escape by
deferring the import. Under that cycle the selectable list can live in one place
only if that place imports nothing: the loader's ``acp_backend`` field metadata,
the dashboard's PATCH allowlist and ``acp.types`` cannot import each other, so each
would otherwise carry its own literal with a drift test standing in for a code
owner. Nothing here imports ``kiro_crew.acp``,
``kiro_crew.config`` or ``kiro_crew.platform``, so all three now derive from this
module — and a plugin-registered backend reaches the dashboard without a core
edit, which a literal could never do.

Whether a registered backend may be selected on a *given deployment* is a separate
question (an enterprise policy bounding the fleet to one harness). It is
deliberately NOT answered here: it needs a governance ceiling, resolving a ceiling
reaches ``current_context()``, and that call's lazy branch loads config — so asking
it from :func:`resolve_selected_backend`, which runs inside
``KiroCrewConfig.load()``, re-enters that load and recurses. Keeping this module
capability-only is what makes the load path safe.

Where this module lives, and why it moved
-----------------------------------------
This file WAS ``kiro_crew/acp_backends.py``. RFC PR 3 offered two ways to stop
application code from asking a backend's IDENTITY: move the tables in here, or
leave them where they were and put a query layer in front. Option 1 — the move —
is what landed, because a table left outside the boundary keeps its old import
path reachable, and a reachable old path is the one a new consumer finds. The
top-level module survives as a pure re-export shim so no existing call site had
to change in the same commit as the move.

``kiro_crew.acp_backends`` still imports, still exports the same names, and still
mutates the SAME registry state: the shim re-exports the functions defined here
rather than copying them, so ``register_selectable_backend`` and
``apply_selectable_denials`` reach one ``_baseline``/``_selectable`` pair however
they were imported.

The leaf property is preserved and it is load-bearing. Nothing on the import
chain this module now sits behind (``agent_sdk/__init__`` ->
``backend_install`` + ``native_commands`` -> ``agent_sdk.drivers.acp``) imports
``kiro_crew.config``, ``kiro_crew.platform`` or ``kiro_crew.acp`` at module
scope — the driver defers every ACP import into a function body — so
``config.loader`` can still reach the registry from inside
``KiroCrewConfig.load()`` without re-entering it.

Capability-set dispositions
---------------------------
Every ``ACP_BACKENDS_*`` name below is one of three things, and saying which is
what keeps the next reader from exposing a driver-internal membership as a
consumer-facing question. ``test_agent_sdk_capabilities`` fails if a set exists
with no row here.

* **semantic question** — a consumer outside the boundary asks it, so
  :class:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.capabilities.SessionCapabilities` carries a field
  for it and the consumer reads that field, never the set.
* **pre-session registry query** — asked ABOUT a backend id before any session
  exists (config load, the dashboard's option list, an install probe), so a
  session-scoped capability object is the wrong shape for it.
* **driver-internal** — read only inside ``kiro_crew.acp`` while it drives the
  harness. It has no consumer above the boundary and must not grow one.

       purpose, so a preview never reaches high-churn handles. A function rather
       than a set for the reason

# ── Capability: where a harness gets its MCP servers ──

#: Harnesses that receive their MCP servers as a PER-SESSION array on
#: ``session/new`` / ``session/load`` instead of reading an agent file.
#:
#: kiro-cli (and KAS, which is kiro-cli's relay) is handed ``--agent`` and loads
#: the spec itself, so Crew passes it an empty array — a duplicate there would
#: shadow the spec's own entries. claude-agent-acp reads no agent file at all, so
#: the array is the ENTIRE MCP surface of the session: an empty one means the
#: harness works while every Crew tool is silently absent.
#:
#: codex-acp is the second member, and it joins on the same terms rather than on
#: an exact likeness to claude: it does load a config file of its OWN
#: (``~/.codex/config.toml``, which Crew never writes — create-or-decline), and its
#: ``build_session_config`` merges the client's array on top of what that file
#: declared. What makes it a member is the part that matters here: it reads no
#: ``~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json``, so this array is the only channel CREW has, and
#: an empty one means Crew's own control plane never reaches the session.
#:
#: A membership set rather than ``_is_claude`` because this is a property of the
#: transport, not of Anthropic: any ACP adapter that does not read Crew's agent
#: spec belongs here, and the next such harness should join the set rather than
#: add a second branch at the call site (harness-parity H6).
#
# opencode is the third member, and it is here because the reason it was EXCLUDED
# was wrong rather than because anything about the harness changed. That reason read
# its ``initialize`` result -- ``mcpCapabilities: {"http": true, "sse": true}`` --
# as an advertisement carrying "no stdio", and concluded the array could not mount
# the stdio servers Crew puts in it. ACP's ``McpCapabilities`` schema has exactly
# two boolean fields, ``http`` and ``sse``, and NO stdio field, so a conforming
# agent cannot advertise stdio at all and that answer is what full support looks
# like. Absence of a flag that cannot exist is not evidence. Driven against
# opencode 1.18.30, the element ``acp.session_mcp.acp_server_element`` already
# emits is accepted, the named child is spawned, its tools are listed and the
# element's ``env`` reaches it -- so the excluded harness had in fact been serving
# sessions with none of Crew's own tools for no reason at all. The exclusion also
# contradicted the shipped code it sat beside: the shared gateway's broker stubs
# are stdio elements too (``mcp_gateway.session_servers._acp_server_entry``) and
# ``_pooled_mcp_servers`` appended them to this very array for opencode whenever
# pooling was on. See ``providers/mirrors/opencode.py``.

# ── The selectable registry ──

#: What the public edition ships.
#:
#: ``ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE`` is included because the public build can genuinely serve a
#: session with it: ``acp/client.py`` owns the whole spawn path (the ``_is_claude``
#: branch, ``_resolve_claude_acp_bin``, ``_resolve_claude_code_executable``) and the
#: adapter it needs is a PUBLIC npm package (``CLAUDE_ACP_NPM_PKG``). Nothing about it
#: is edition-private. An earlier revision left it out and described it as a "dormant
#: seam ... not something a public build can serve a session with", which made the
#: option render as permanently unavailable on exactly the builds that could run it —
#: the switch was the only missing piece, not the harness.
#:
#: Whether it is USABLE on a given machine is a separate question with its own answer:
#: :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_install` probes for the two binaries and the
#: dashboard reports what is absent plus the command that installs it.
#:
#: ``ACP_BACKEND_CODEX`` is included, and the two things that were missing when it
#: was not are both worth naming, because each was a separate reason:
#:
#: * ``backend_install`` now has a probe, so the install row reads ``missing`` with
#:   the component and the command rather than ``unknown``. A switch that cannot say
#:   what is absent when a session fails is a switch offered ahead of the code that
#:   answers for it.
#: * its tool calls are ROUTED. ``acp_tool_gate`` verifies ``session/new``
#:   advertised ``mode=read-only`` and applies it before the first prompt, refusing
#:   the session otherwise, so the PreToolUse gate is armed for the calls it makes.
#:
#: One gap REMAINS and is survivable rather than closed: ACP v1 offers no way to
#: make an adapter ask for a passive READ, so the sensitive-path block cannot see
#: reads this harness performs. What made that dangerous was the credential homes
#: the standard sandbox tier leaves open, and those are denied to its child at the
#: OS boundary by ``acp_tool_gate.adapter_hidden_credential_dirs`` -- derived from
#: the read-gate floor itself, so the compensating control covers exactly what the
#: control it compensates for covers, minus the harness's own token store.
#: ``ACP_BACKEND_OPENCODE`` is included on the same two conditions Codex had to
#: meet, and it meets them by a different mechanism:
#:
#: * ``backend_install`` probes for the ``opencode`` binary, so the install row
#:   names the component and the command that installs it rather than reading
#:   ``unknown``.
#: * its tool calls are ROUTED, and the routing is VERIFIED rather than declared.
#:   OpenCode asks per tool call only while its own ``permission`` setting is
#:   ``ask``; its default is permissive. So the client supplies ``permission: "ask"``
#:   as inline config in the child's environment -- which this harness resolves
#:   above its own project config file, so nothing is written into a checked-out
#:   repository -- then READS THE HARNESS'S OWN RESOLVED CONFIGURATION BACK and
#:   refuses the session when the required value is not in force. See
#:   :data:`Routing.VERIFIED_SEEDED_SETTINGS`.

# ── Policy-facing spelling ──

#: kiro-cli, not KAS, deliberately: KAS is not an independent harness — it is
#: served by kiro-cli's own ACP relay (``acp/kas_transport.build_kas_argv`` returns
#: ``[kiro_bin, "acp", "--agent-engine", "v3", "--auth-method", "cli"]``), so a KAS
#: floor would rest on the same binary while adding a second thing that can be
#: absent. The floor has to be the member with the fewest preconditions of its own.

# spawn_continue (conversation_gone). KAS therefore opts in only once a
# keep-aware teardown lands (native subagent work); until then its subagents get
# dedicated sessions. claude-agent-acp runs through AcpClient (one process per
# session) and is not a member. codex-acp is not either, for the same reason: one
# adapter process serves one session, so there is nothing to share.

# the template from disk at spawn and exposes no wire channel, so a member

# codex-acp is NOT a member, and the reason is scope rather than capability.
# ``providers/mirrors/codex.py`` gives it the per-session mount its earlier
# exclusion was waiting on, and its precondition needs no new gate: codex's
# routing is ``SESSION_CONFIG``, the one mechanism in
# ``tool_gate.ENFORCED_ROUTINGS``, so a session that cannot arm ``mode=read-only``
# is refused before its first prompt — structurally stronger than claude's
# ``settings.local.json`` ownership check, which covers a routing this core
# declares and does not enforce. What is missing is a DECISION, not a
# mechanism: mounting session control into a codex DM thread is a new capability,
# separate from giving a codex session the tools its own agent spec declares, and
# it belongs to whoever decides member threads should run on codex at all. Until
# then a codex member session stays plain chat — the dispatch tools are simply not
# mounted, never mounted-and-refused.
#
# opencode is excluded, but NOT any longer for want of a mount: it is a member of
# ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY`` and its sessions now carry Crew's control
# plane, so the transport a member dispatch would ride on exists. What is missing is
# the same DECISION codex is waiting on -- mounting session control into a member DM
# thread is a new capability, separate from giving a session the tools its own agent

# build behaves exactly as the frozenset above says: the FOREGROUND start path asks
# "is this backend on the shared runtime?" through :func:`acp_runtime_backends`,
# which with the switch unset returns that frozenset verbatim, so a codex session
# still gets its own AcpClient process. The background ``_bg`` path does not ask
# through this function at all -- ``session._bg_runtime_backends`` reads the
# frozenset directly, so the switch cannot reach it even when it is on. Its reason
# is in ``session.py`` beside that reader: codex's teardown verb ends a turn without
# evicting the session, and background handles churn at a rate the user never

# being folded into the commit that writes the harness. So the harness lands
# first, dark, with a switch that exercises it; then the member lands and this
# switch is deleted. Deleting it is the whole flip: nothing else moves.
#
# Why an env read rather than a second registry. ``register_selectable_backend``
# exists because an EDITION must be able to add a harness this build has never
# heard of. Nothing of the kind is happening here -- codex is already known and
# already selectable, and the only open question is which transport it takes --
# so a registry would be a mutable global that one caller writes once. An env read
# holds no state, is re-read per call so a test can turn it on around a single

# holds a signed-in identity of its own it spawns the relay WITHOUT
# ``--auth-method cli`` (see :func:`kiro_crew.acp.kas_transport.build_kas_argv`),
# which leaves the engine's credential callback on the wire for Crew to answer.
# Membership is what authorizes the runtime to hand a credential to a child at
# all; a request with that method from any non-member is answered
# method-not-found like every other ownerless request, never with a token.
# Positive membership rather than ``== ACP_BACKEND_KAS`` in the shared runtime
# (harness-parity H5). Distinct from ``host_auth.backends_retired_by_host_logout()``
# on purpose:
# "may be handed Crew's credential" and "is invalidated by a kiro-cli logout" are
# different properties, and a member here that is spawned in cli-owned mode (no
# Crew identity stored) never receives the callback in the first place.
# opencode is not a member: it authenticates from its own credential file, and its

# fresh session rather than a failed load. A SET rather than a chain of identity

# ── How a harness is made to ask ──
# Kiro Crew's PreToolUse gate -- the bundled denied-command rules, the
# sensitive-path block, the governance ceiling -- runs from exactly ONE place,
# ``HookManager.on_tool_call``, reached only from the permission-request branch of
# the dispatch parser. A harness that does not send ``session/request_permission``
# per tool call is a harness where none of those controls execute. So "how is this
# one made to ask?" is a security property, not a compatibility note, and it is
# named here rather than assumed at each call site.


class Routing(str, Enum):
    """The mechanism that makes a harness ask before it runs a tool.

    ``AGENT_SPEC`` -- the spawn names an agent, so the harness asks by
    construction and there is nothing to probe or apply.

    ``SESSION_CONFIG`` -- the ACP v1 session advertises a config option whose
    enforced value makes privileged tools ask. Kiro Crew verifies the option is
    advertised and applies it before the first prompt.

    ``SEEDED_SETTINGS`` -- the harness is made to ask by a settings file Kiro
    Crew writes, so the precondition would be confirmable by reading back what was
    written. **Declared but not enforced by this core**, because that read-back
    does not exist. ``AcpClient._write_claude_local_settings`` does seed
    ``permissions.defaultMode``, but it is a CONDITIONAL write: it touches only the
    file Crew owns (created this session, bytes still Crew's) and otherwise leaves
    the path alone, and nothing confirms the adapter honoured the mode afterwards.
    So a ``bypassPermissions`` already present in a user's own
    ``settings.local.json`` or ``~/.claude`` is neither detected nor stripped, and
    the guarantee cannot be asserted. Recorded as a known gap rather than papered
    over with a ``ROUTED`` this core cannot earn -- see
    ``docs/system-specs/modules/harness-onboarding.md``.

    ``VERIFIED_SEEDED_SETTINGS`` -- the harness is made to ask by a setting Kiro
    Crew supplies as the session starts, AND the precondition is confirmed by
    reading the harness's OWN RESOLVED configuration back before the first prompt.
    The read-back is the whole difference from ``SEEDED_SETTINGS``, and it is what
    this mechanism can assert that the other cannot: a value the harness's own
    config already carried, or a seed that did not take effect, is OBSERVED rather
    than assumed. Where the read-back cannot confirm the required value the verdict
    is INDETERMINATE and the session is refused, so a harness whose own default is
    permissive cannot present a gate that gates nothing.

    Where the setting TRAVELS is the driver's business, not this vocabulary's, and
    it is not necessarily a file: the one member today passes it as inline config in
    the child's environment, which that harness resolves above its own project
    config file -- so a session establishes the guarantee without writing anything
    into a checked-out repository.

    ``UNVERIFIED`` -- Kiro Crew has NOT established how, or whether, this harness
    can be made to ask. This member exists so "we do not know" is a state a
    caller must handle rather than an absent case that falls through to a
    permissive branch. It always resolves INDETERMINATE, which refuses.
