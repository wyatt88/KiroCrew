"""ACP Runtime for multiplexed kiro-cli sessions.

Single-reader demux architecture: one AcpRuntime owns the subprocess and a
reader task that routes frames by sessionId to per-session queues. Each
``AcpSessionHandle`` (in ``session_handle.py``) owns one sessionId + queue and
provides the prompt/cancel/approve/reject API.

The per-session handle, the runtime protocol it depends on, and the runtime
exceptions live in ``session_handle.py`` (the lower layer); they are re-exported
here so ``from kiro_crew.acp.runtime import AcpSessionHandle`` (and the
exceptions) keeps working for existing callers and tests.

        shuts the session's agent down (reaping its MCP child processes). WITHOUT

        Guard (A2) — the spawn-flag half of Guard (A) in :meth:`create_session`.
        ``set_mode`` only ever activates an EXPLICIT override (or, on KAS, the
        injected default), so on kiro-cli the agent chosen by ``--agent`` — the
        agent of every ordinary session — reaches no availability check at all.
        It needs one, because that spec can fail to load silently: kiro-cli
        validates ``~/.kiro/agents/<agent>.json`` with ``deny_unknown_fields``
        and, on ANY unknown field, rejects the spec wholesale and runs its own
        default agent instead. :func:`kiro_crew.agent.migrate_agent_specs` exists
        to strip the two keys already known to trip it; nothing validates the
        rest, and a spec written by another tool (or by a product this install
        superseded) can carry more.

        Nothing downstream notices the substitution. The ``set_mode`` response is
        never read back, ``currentModeId`` is never re-compared, and
        :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.mcp_session_report` only LOGS — its own docstring
        forbids reading a missing report as "not mounted". The session then runs
        with NONE of Kiro Crew's control plane, while the global provider
        ``mcp.json`` that Kiro Crew pins off only on specs IT writes stays
        merged. So third-party MCP servers declared there keep working and every
        Kiro Crew tool the injected prompt names — ``learn_add`` among them —
        answers "does not exist", which the agent reports to the user as its
        memory being unavailable.

        Skipped when an override is requested: Guard (A) checks the agent
        ``set_mode`` will activate.

        ``currentModeId`` is read as PROOF, in both directions. A live probe of
        this backend settles what it means: a spec that loads is reported as the
        current mode AND listed in ``availableModes``, while a spec the backend
        refuses is absent from the list and ``currentModeId`` names the backend's
        own default instead. So a non-empty ``currentModeId`` naming something
        OTHER than the spawn agent is positive evidence of the substitution, and
        fails closed even when no advertised list came back. Treating a
        current-mode mismatch as an extra ADMIT is the hole this avoids: a
        ``currentModeId``-only response naming a substituted agent would otherwise
        sail through the compatibility escape.

        That escape is therefore narrow. It applies only when the response names
        NO current mode, where the advertised list is the sole signal and its
        absence is no evidence of a substitution -- so older kiro-cli and the
        offline fake backend behave exactly as before.

        Asked of the harness, which answers yes only for a host whose argv
        actually carries ``--agent``. Never phrased as an inequality: a negative
        test would silently capture every host added later (harness-parity H5),
        and a host that activates its agent by ``set_mode`` already has that
        response as proof -- on KAS the agent travels over the wire as an injected
        custom agent and Guard (A) covers it. Asked of the host rather than of
        "the KAS projection came back None" so the same call serves
        :meth:`load_session`, which never builds that projection.

        is edited. Any failure terminates *session_id* first: ``session/new`` or
        ``session/load`` already succeeded, so the session exists in the host and a
        plain local unregister would leak it in the shared process.

        A ``set_mode`` naming an agent activates that agent's spec, and the spec it
        activates needs the same bracket the spawn's does. Neither other gate reaches
        here: the spawn gate is keyed to ``self._agent``, so a SHARED runtime spawned
        as one agent and switched to another on this line passes no gate, and a host
        that builds no in-process tool surface never runs ``session_mcp``'s gate.

        WHERE the spec is consumed differs by host, and that decides which snapshot the
        post-check may use -- exactly ONE per consumed load:

        * ``wire_registered`` -- the spec was consumed at ``session/new``, in the wire
          payload built under the projection's own gate; ``set_mode`` activates what is
          already registered and re-reads nothing. A fresh read HERE would judge the
          file while the host holds the payload, so a revocation landing between the
          build and this line would pass that read while the registered definition
          still carried the grants it removed. The post-check compares against the
          payload's OWN snapshot. No gate call on this path: a second snapshot for one
          consumed load is the defect, not a safeguard.
        * otherwise -- the spec is consumed HERE: kiro-cli reads it from disk at
          ``set_mode`` and boots that agent's MCP servers. Gated BEFORE the send,
          because a stale mirror activated here mounts and auto-approves a server the
          default agent does not have.

        After the send returns the host has consumed the spec, which closes the window
        the snapshot opened: a write landing before that point is caught, and one
        landing after cannot change what was already consumed. Same answer as the

        must not survive.
