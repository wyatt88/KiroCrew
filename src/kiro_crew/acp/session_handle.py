"""AcpSessionHandle — one multiplexed ACP session on a shared runtime.

Split out of ``runtime.py`` to keep the two responsibilities in separate files:

- ``session_handle.py`` (this file): the per-session API surface — one
  ``sessionId`` + its ``asyncio.Queue``, the prompt/cancel/approve/reject event
  loop, and the per-session stale/stall watchdog. Depends only on the runtime
  *protocol* (``AcpRuntimeProtocol``), the shared dispatch parser, and the ACP
  types — never on the concrete ``AcpRuntime``.
- ``runtime.py``: ``AcpRuntime`` — owns the subprocess + single-reader demux and
  constructs handles.

The runtime exceptions (``AcpRuntimeError`` / ``AcpRuntimeDead``) and the
``AcpRuntimeProtocol`` live here (the lower layer) so ``runtime.py`` imports them
from this module without a circular import; ``runtime.py`` re-exports them so
existing ``from kiro_crew.acp.runtime import AcpSessionHandle`` call sites keep
working.

        - ``_PROMPT_TRANSPORT_COMMANDS`` (/compact, /help) — kiro-cli 2.14.0
          returns no response for these over commands/execute, and the
          compaction flow (session.py, Slack !compact) depends on watching
          ``compaction/status`` on the prompt stream.
        - a non-kiro backend (KAS) — ``_kiro.dev/commands/execute`` is
          kiro-cli-specific; KAS sessions keep degrading softly through
          session/prompt instead of erroring on an unimplemented method.

        The native turn is bounded at ``_COMMAND_TURN_TIMEOUT_SECS`` (matching
        send_command's RPC wait) because neither turn watchdog arms on a
        command turn; an explicit ``timeout`` still wins.

        Both boundaries that drop the evidence baseline — turn start in
        ``prompt()`` and each new tool dispatch — retire rather than
        ``reset()``, because ``_consult_oracle_offloaded`` submits a BOUND oracle
        method to ``subprocess_executor()``: a walk whose await already timed out
        keeps running and keeps a reference to the instance it was handed. Samples
        are keyed ``"io"``/``"cpu"`` with no PID, so clearing in place lets that
        late writer repopulate the baseline the next generation reads, and since
        any nonzero delta counts as movement a flat tick then reads WORKING.

        The tool path has a second, sharper version of the same hazard that the
        capture path does not: ``_check_shell_child`` matches a descendant against
        the *dispatched* command and stores it as ``_tracked_child`` for exact
        exit detection on later ticks. A walk carrying the PREVIOUS tool's
        ``ToolCallState`` therefore writes a child of the previous command into
        the live oracle, and the new tool's next tick reports
        ``WORKING "shell child N alive"`` on a process that has nothing to do with
        it. Retiring confines both writes to an instance nobody reads.

        Retirement is not a semantic change for the cross-tick tracked-child
        contract itself: ``fresh()`` starts with exactly the state ``reset()``
        produced (no tracked child, no grace timestamp, no samples), and the
        consult resolves ``self._oracle`` at submission, so every tick after the
        boundary binds and accumulates on the new instance the way it did before.

        The future must be retired TOGETHER with the oracle. Replacing only the
        oracle would leave a walk wedged in the previous generation answering
        every later tick "prior consult still in flight", so the new generation
        would never sample its own process — the tool branch would then run on
        UNKNOWN and end a healthy tool call at the suspect window.

        Releasing the future costs at most one abandoned worker per boundary
        instead of one per tick. ``fresh()`` rather than a default construction so
        the per-session ``wellness_sample_secs`` (and an injected /proc root or
        clock in tests) survives the swap.

        Parity with AcpClient._drain_notifications. During session setup there is

        init-time notification. Draining them here keeps them out of the first
        turn's event stream and gives MCP servers a window to report in before
        the first prompt races ahead.

        The idle shortcut means "quiet AFTER the servers reported", not "quiet,
        therefore done": until the first MCP registration frame (initialized /
        init_failure / oauth_request) is observed, queue silence is treated as a
        server still booting and the drain keeps waiting, bounded by
        ``no_report_ceiling`` (defaults to ``_MCP_DRAIN_NO_REPORT_CEILING``,
        resolved at call time so tests can shrink the module constant). Once a
        report has been seen, the drain allows up to ``duration`` more and exits
        after ``idle_exit`` seconds of silence, so warm sessions — whose
        registration frames were staged during session/new — arm immediately and
        pay no extra latency. ``config_option_update`` frames refresh cached
        configOptions; OAuth requests remain drainable via
        ``pop_pending_oauth_requests``; everything else is logged/discarded.
        Best-effort — never raises.

        ``stale_report_frames``: how many frames on the queue describe the roster
        that initialized during ``session/new``. For a session whose mode was
        then SWITCHED via ``set_mode``, that is the PRE-switch agent's roster,
        and the switched-to agent's own servers may still be booting. Those
        frames are still drained and processed normally; they just neither arm
        the idle shortcut nor enter the report.

        The COUNT is the caller's to measure, and it must be read before the
        ``set_mode`` request goes out — the only moment "already queued" and
        "pre-switch" mean the same thing. Measuring it here instead would count
        the switched-to agent's own registrations, which the backend can emit
        before it answers set_mode, and consume them without recording: a
