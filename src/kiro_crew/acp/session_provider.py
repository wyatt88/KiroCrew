"""AcpSessionProvider — adapts AcpSessionHandle to the LLMProvider interface.

Used by Phase 3 session sharing AND the unified kiro-path provider. When
the kiro backend is active, AcpProvider delegates to an AcpSessionProvider
(backed by AcpRuntime + AcpSessionHandle) instead of AcpClient. This gives:
- Single-reader demux: parent session + N subagents on one process
- LLMProvider interface: SubagentManager, chat_runner, etc. work unchanged
- AcpClient-compatible API: AcpProvider can call the same methods regardless
  of backend (kiro → AcpSessionProvider, CC → AcpClient)

The adapter exposes the SAME public interface as AcpClient so AcpProvider
doesn't need to branch on every method call.
