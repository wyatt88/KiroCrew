# ── ACP Backend Identifiers ──
# DEFINED in :mod:`kiro_crew.acp_backends` and re-exported from the import block
# at the top of this module, so ``from kiro_crew.acp.types import ACP_BACKEND_*``
# resolves here for its ~19 call sites.
#
# The definitions live outside this package: importing anything under
# ``kiro_crew.acp`` executes its ``__init__`` (client + runtime), so the loader's
# field metadata and the dashboard's PATCH allowlist cannot read them from here
# without dragging that in, and would each need a literal copy of the selectable
# list. ``acp_backends`` imports nothing from this package, so it can be the
# single code owner.
#
# The selectable set is not a constant either: it is a REGISTRY an edition
# extends (``register_selectable_backend``). A frozen ``ACP_BACKENDS_SELECTABLE``
# snapshot here would be read before boot registration and silently miss it.

# ── Capability membership ──
# The ``ACP_BACKENDS_*`` capability sets are DEFINED in the leaf module
# ``kiro_crew.acp_backends`` and re-exported by the import above, so
# ``from kiro_crew.acp.types import ACP_BACKENDS_STEER`` resolves. They live there
# for the same reason the backend identifiers do: a consumer outside this package
# must be able to ask a capability question without importing ``kiro_crew.acp``,
# whose ``__init__`` pulls in the client and runtime.

# ── Provider labels ──
# The backend identity key persisted in the session map. It indexes three
# things, so every producer must agree on it: resume compatibility
# (detect_provider_switch), session-map persistence, and session-file cleanup
# routing. Defined here rather than in providers.acp because session.py needs
# the vocabulary and cannot import that module at module scope.
#
# An absent label means kiro-cli, which is the default backend.

# KAS reads only fs.readTextFile / fs.writeTextFile / terminal from the top
# level of clientCapabilities; every other capability it honours lives under
# _meta.kiro. The ones there are CALLBACK capabilities — KAS calls back into the

# (Auto-mode / permission-UI parity). ``AcpClient._write_claude_local_settings``
# is the writer; these exist so it and the client's ``permission_mode`` kwarg
# share one vocabulary rather than duplicating string literals.

# adapter treats as "never call the host back at all", which would take a claude
# session out of the host gate entirely. Named so that value has one spelling
# here rather than a literal at each guard.
#
# It does NOT describe an inherited file. The settings writer is create-or-decline
# and never READS a file it did not author, so a ``bypassPermissions`` already
# sitting in a user's own ``settings.local.json`` (or in ``~/.claude``) is neither
# detected nor stripped -- that session's tool calls do not reach the host gate.

STOP_REASON_TOOL_STALL = "error: tool stall"
# Signalled by the ACP layer when automatic compaction reported `failed`
# and the backend then abandoned the turn (no prompt response, no
# end_turn) past the post-failure budget. Kept in the "error:" family so

    caller then falls back to deny-by-default).

    The ``use_aws`` synthesis serializes ``parameters`` / ``positional_args``
    into the tail so the security gate scans the FULL payload — a shell
    command smuggled inside ``ssm send-command`` parameters (e.g.
    ``{"commands": ["cat ~/.aws/credentials"]}``) is visible to

    - **Whitespace fail-closed**: ``service_name`` and ``operation_name``
      containing whitespace return None (deny-by-default) rather than
      synthesizing a multi-token string that could confuse downstream parsers.
    - **Best-effort caveat**: the serialized ``parameters`` tail uses
      ``json.dumps`` whose escaping (``\\"``, ``\\\\``) may render embedded
      payloads in a form the shell-text matchers were not authored for. This is

        rather than the literal command (``select_tool_title`` prefers
        ``description``), so security gates must evaluate THIS instead of the

        deny-by-default (``is_shell`` with an unrecoverable command must NOT be
        gated on the untrusted title alone; see ``HookManager.on_tool_call``).

        The command is recovered from two shapes because different event kinds
        populate different fields:
        - ``raw_tool_params`` dict (tool_call / tool_call_update events), or
        - ``tool_input`` JSON string (permission_request events, where the ACP
          ``toolCall`` params are resolved into ``tool_input`` and
          ``raw_tool_params`` is NOT set — this is the dashboard's primary

        Two parameter shapes are recognized within each source:
        - Bash-style: a literal ``command`` string — returned verbatim.
        - Structured AWS CLI (kiro-cli ``use_aws``): ``service_name`` +
          ``operation_name`` (+ ``parameters``/``positional_args``). kiro-cli

        matched against ``@server/tool`` — the hook reports these with

        Requirements, each fail-closed on its cache: a child origin

        (``not is_shell`` — a frame whose ``kind`` resolved to execute cached
        True, and its deny gates need the command bytes this event lacks; the

        ``mcp_server_name`` + ``tool_name`` pair recovered from the tool_call

        an identity pair written by any future inline/agent-authored fallback
        stays untrusted until that site earns the flag.

        ``shell_classified`` is deliberately NOT required: a backend may omit
        ``kind`` on its MCP tool_call frames, leaving the shell cache
        unwritten. The trusted transport identity is itself proof the call is
        MCP-served and therefore not a host shell command — but that proof
