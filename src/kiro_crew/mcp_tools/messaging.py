"""The outbound delivery to the user across chat surfaces tools: what they advertise and what they do.

``schemas()`` returns the ADVERTISEMENT half of each tool -- its name, the
model-facing description, and the JSON Schema a call is validated against.
``HANDLERS`` maps each of those names to the function that runs it. Both halves
of a tool live here so its contract and its behavior are read together, and
``test_mcp_tool_registry`` fails if one arrives without the other.

Handlers reach this server's shared plumbing as attributes of ``mcp_core`` --
``mcp_core._post``, the identity resolvers, the governance vets. That is
deliberate rather than untidy: an attribute lookup resolves at CALL time, so a
test that rebinds one on the module still intercepts the handler. Importing
those names directly here would bind them at import time and silently escape
every existing patch site.

#: ``session`` values that name a chat channel rather than a delivery mode. Each
#: one delivers a DM to that channel's own configured owner: the gateway resolves
#: the destination from the transport's configured-target allowlist, so the
#: agent cannot address anyone the user has not configured for that channel.
#:
#: DERIVED from the channel roster, not hand-listed, for the reason
#: ``SEND_MESSAGE_SCHEMA`` already gives about ``channel_type``: a second copy of
#: the roster goes stale when a transport is added. This one had. It read
#: ``("discord",)`` while the gateway leg it feeds
#: (``dashboard/handlers/messaging.py::_deliver_channel_dm``) was already
#: channel-neutral — it looks the transport up by name and takes the destination
#: from that transport's own ``configured_targets()`` — so the eight other
#: registered channels were refused HERE, by a validator, on their way to a leg
#: that could serve them.
#:
#: Widening the accepted set does not widen the reachable AUDIENCE. Whether a
#: given channel can actually take a proactive DM is answered per send by
#: ``_owner_dm_target``, which returns a target only when the transport
#: advertises exactly ONE available direct target: a channel that needs prior
#: inbound state (Teams, WeCom) or cannot DM proactively at all (Feishu) marks
#: its targets unavailable and still degrades to the dashboard notification, and
#: an ambiguous allow-list is refused rather than guessed at. That gate is at the
#: side-effect boundary and reads live config, which is where it has to be — a
#: static tuple here cannot answer a runtime question.
#:
#: The two exclusions live with the roster in ``constants.CHANNEL_SEND_NAMESPACES``,
#: which the gateway's accepted ``channel_type`` set and the validator's pattern
#: also read, so the subtraction is not respelled per reader. This leg reads the
#: narrower ``CHANNEL_OWNER_DM_NAMESPACES``, because inferring an OWNER needs the
#: transport to tell configured recipients from peers learned off inbound traffic
#: and not every one does -- the reason is recorded at that definition.
_CHANNEL_SESSIONS: tuple[str, ...] = CHANNEL_OWNER_DM_NAMESPACES

#: Every accepted ``session`` value. The advertised enum is built from this, so
#: the contract the model is shown and the validation a call is held to cannot
#: drift apart.
_SESSION_TARGETS: tuple[str, ...] = ("origin", "slack", *_CHANNEL_SESSIONS)

#: Options that exist only in Slack's protocol: a Block Kit layout, a Slack
#: channel/user id, a Slack thread timestamp and its broadcast flag, and Slack's
#: link/media unfurling. Combining one with a ``_CHANNEL_SESSIONS`` value is
#: refused rather than delivered with the option dropped, because the caller has
#: no way to observe the drop: a threaded reply would arrive as a fresh DM, and a
#: send addressed at a named Slack channel would land in a private DM instead.
