"""Open a URL the dashboard OWNER typed into the Browser panel, in the gateway host's browser.

The Browser panel has two transports. In the desktop app a native Chromium view
owns the panel and an external site lands there. Everywhere else -- a plain
browser tab, including a laptop reaching a remote gateway over an SSH tunnel --
the only browser that can render an external site is the Playwright CLI's, on the
gateway host, shown through the ``show`` dashboard that :mod:`view` supervises.
The CLI's own dashboard cannot open a session by itself (its bundle renders "No
open sessions." and offers navigation only inside one that already exists), and
every other ``playwright-cli`` invocation is an agent's shell turn, so without
this module the address bar would point a CSP-blocked iframe at ``google.com``
and report the site as "not reachable".

This module is that launcher. It runs the CLI as a supervised subprocess,
exactly as :mod:`view` runs ``show``: ``playwright-cli -s=<session> goto <url>``
when the session's browser is up, ``open <url>`` when the CLI's own ``list``
says it is not (a bare ``open`` on a live session tears that browser down and
starts another, losing its tabs). The human then sees and drives the page in the
framed ``show`` view.

**Consent.** The capability model routes AGENT browsing through the shell approval
ladder, and this endpoint would let an agent skip it, so the route is owner-only
and refuses ``X-Internal-Secret`` callers (:func:`handlers.api_browser_open`). A
human pressing Enter in an authenticated dashboard IS the approval. That is also
why the spawn is benign for ``test_spawn_audit``: the only free input is a URL the
owner typed, validated to ``http``/``https`` before it reaches argv.

**Session naming and ownership.** One session per dashboard chat slot,
``panel-<owner6>-<slot8>``: a digest of this gateway's data home, then one of the
slot's session key. The name deliberately does NOT match the generated
``kc-<8hex>`` shape: the orphan sweep (``session_pid``) reclaims a ``kc-`` daemon
as soon as no live process carries its ``PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION``, and the only
process that ever carries this one is the short-lived CLI invocation itself -- a
generated name would have the sweep kill the human's browser out from under them
ten minutes in. A ``panel-`` session is therefore operator-class to the sweep
(structurally excluded, never signalled) and its lifetime is owned HERE, by the
gateway whose tag it carries. Several gateways on one host can share the CLI's
session registry (same ``HOME`` and working directory: a pod started from the
live checkout, a second install), so the owner is made legible from the name:
a sibling never produces this gateway's tag, a ``goto`` against a session
already open under our name can only be reaching this gateway's own previous
life, and only sessions under our prefix are ever closed -- every one this life
opened at shutdown (:func:`close_all`, hooked beside :func:`view.stop`), and
any a previous life left behind at startup (:func:`reclaim_stranded`). A panel
session never outlives the gateway that owns it; an unclean death only defers
the close to the next start.

Every function here blocks on a subprocess; a caller on the event loop offloads it.
