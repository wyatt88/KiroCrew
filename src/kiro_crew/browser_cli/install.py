"""Detection, installation, and the capability gate for ``@playwright/cli``.

The CLI has no capability gating of its own — every command is available to
whoever can run the binary — so :func:`available` reports host capability only.
It is not an approval decision: dashboard shell turns still follow the ordinary
approval ladder unless the user has granted trust or enabled auto-approve.

Installation is global within a product-owned npm prefix rather than ``npx``.
``npx`` re-resolves the package through the registry on every invocation, so an
expired registry token would take browsing down at use time. The managed prefix
is ``<data-home>/playwright-cli``. Every agent sandbox exposes that leaf
read-only, and gateway execution resolves it by absolute path before considering
fixed, non-writable system locations. ``PATH`` is never an execution source.

Node is located through :func:`kiro_crew.env.find_node_tool` rather than bare
``shutil.which``: the gateway can run with a PATH that omits the version-manager
shim directory a managed npm install needs at execution time.

Every function here blocks (subprocess, filesystem), so a caller on the event
loop offloads it.

    The gateway's own PATH is not sufficient: a global ``npm install -g`` lands
    in a version-manager-owned bin directory that the gateway process may never
    have had on PATH, so a child that inherits it unchanged cannot find the
    binary that was just installed.

    Two layers, node bins outermost so they win:

    1. :func:`node_augmented_path` prepends the Node bin dirs, so ``npm``/``node``
       resolve to the managed toolchain.
    2. :func:`augmented_path` (the inner layer) contributes the broad non-login
       PATH -- ``~/.local/bin``, ``/opt/homebrew/bin``, the mise shims -- because
       the mise-managed per-version ``npm`` is itself a wrapper script that runs
       ``mise reshim`` after a global install. That hook needs the ``mise``
       binary itself on PATH, and mise installs to ``~/.local/bin`` (or
       Homebrew's bin), NOT to any Node bin dir. A GUI- or daemon-launched
       gateway inherits a minimal PATH lacking those dirs, so without this layer
       the wrapper dies ``mise: command not found`` and, under its
       ``set -euo pipefail``, fails the whole ``npm install -g`` with rc 127.

    This PATH is execution support only. :func:`cli_path` does not consume it:
    gateway execution resolves the sandbox-sealed managed entrypoint or a fixed,
