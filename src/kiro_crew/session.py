"""Session manager — maps conversation session keys to LLM provider sessions.

Each conversation (channel thread, dashboard slot, CLI) gets its own
LLMProvider instance. Sessions are
cleaned up after idle timeout (default 60 min).

Warm session pool: ``start_pool()`` pre-spawns kiro-cli processes so
``get_or_create()`` returns instantly.  After handing out a warm session,
a replacement is created in the background to maintain the target count.

Background session: ``BACKGROUND_KEY`` is a persistent shared session for
lightweight background work (heartbeat, lesson extraction).  It
stays alive between uses, serialized by the per-session semaphore.

At >= ``cfg.session.autocompact_pct`` context usage, fires a background
compaction task. A backend that can serve ``/compact`` compacts **in
place** so the session — and any queued or agentic work on it —
continues without a user nudge; one that cannot is declined before any
dispatch:

* **kiro-cli:** run ``/compact`` in place under the session semaphore
  (native command execute + ``_kiro.dev/compaction/status`` wait). The
  process and session ID survive; the conversation is summarized in
  place. If the in-place compact fails or times out, fall back to the
  legacy **recycle**: kill the session and let the next user message
  re-seed context via ``build_session_context()`` (the stale resume SID is
  cleared while the session-map entry and channel linkage remain). A recycle is never
  forced through a live turn — if the turn semaphore cannot be acquired,
  the attempt is skipped and re-triggered at the next turn end.
* **claude-agent-acp:** run ``/compact`` in place under the session
  semaphore. The SDK preserves the same session ID across the
  compact_boundary; the session keeps its summary and continues without
  a recycle.
* **KAS:** nothing is dispatched. KAS treats the ``/compact`` prompt as
  ordinary text and never answers it with a compaction status, so the
  gate declines (``compact_unsupported``) before the compaction task is
  scheduled: an ungated dispatch strands the wait for the full budget
  while holding the semaphore and then recycles the session. KAS
  summarizes on its own initiative, the same way ``cc_managed`` leaves
  Claude-Code sessions to compact themselves.

A failed compact records a per-key cooldown so a broken /compact does
not fire on every subsequent turn. The compact callback fires on both
success and failure; the dashboard uses ``success`` to choose the
banner copy. The user's response is never blocked — compaction is
fire-and-forget.

Circuit breaker: after 5 consecutive failures on a session, the session
is force-reset instead of retrying forever.

Per-session semaphore: serializes prompts on the same session key so
concurrent messages on the same conversation don't interleave.

Process Sweep Architecture
--------------------------
Four mechanisms clean up processes. They are complementary — not redundant.

1. ``cleanup_orphaned_sessions()`` — **startup + shutdown only**.
   Reads ``kiro_session_pids.txt`` (bare sandbox root PIDs from the previous
   gateway run). Validates each with ``_is_managed_agent_process``, kills descendants
   bottom-up, then kills the root. Truncates the file afterward.
   *Cannot be replaced by the periodic sweep* because sandbox roots are
   independent processes with no idle timeout — they survive indefinitely
   unless explicitly killed.

2. ``_cleanup_orphaned_mcp_servers()`` — **periodic** (every ~5 min).
   Reads ``kiro_pids.txt`` (child:parent pairs). Kills children whose parent
   is confirmed dead. PPid-based reuse guard prevents killing recycled PIDs.
   Also prunes dead bare PIDs. *Depends on (1)* — children are only orphaned
   after their sandbox root is killed.

3. ``_expire_idle()`` — **periodic** (every ~5 min).
   Kills sessions idle for >``timeout_secs`` (default 60 min) via
   ``reset()`` → ``provider.shutdown()`` → SIGKILL process tree.
   Protected keys: ``_PERSISTENT_KEYS`` (``_bg`` and ``_hb``).
   **Known limitation**: ``last_used`` is only bumped on ``get_or_create()``,
   not on every LLM round-trip. A task runner step doing continuous work for
   >60 min without a new ``get_or_create()`` call could be swept. This is
   accepted for now to prevent runaway tasks, but may need a heartbeat or
   persistent-key mechanism if longer steps become common.
