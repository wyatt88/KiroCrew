    Returns a list of ``AgentInfo`` objects. Each agent corresponds to a kiro-cli
    agent config file that can be selected via ``session/set_mode`` in the ACP
    protocol.

    Two scopes are searched when *project_dir* is given: the user-level directory
    (``~/.kiro/agents``, or *agents_dir*) and the project's own
    (``<project>/.kiro/agents`` plus ``<project>/.kiro/*.agent-spec.json``). A
    project agent SHADOWS a user-level agent of the same name and the shadowing is
    logged, mirroring kiro-cli — which resolves ``--agent`` against its cwd first,
    and is spawned by Kiro Crew with the session's project dir as that cwd. The
    losing entry is not returned: it is unreachable for this session, so listing it
    would offer an agent that cannot run.

    Omitting *project_dir* preserves the user-level-only behavior, which is what
    callers with no session context (and therefore no project) want.

    Results are cached per scope pair and reused while both directory signatures
    are unchanged, so repeated calls avoid re-reading and re-parsing every agent
    JSON on the event loop.
