"""Keystone: the sensitive-path lists, the resolver, the gates.

This is the always-on floor. Every other tier can be narrowed on the argument
that the OS sandbox sees the same thing; these declarations are the record of
what must stay unreadable and unwritable to the agent no matter which sandbox is
in force, and the gates below are what roughly forty modules import by name.

The comments on the declarations carry more weight than the code does: each one
records why an entry sits on the read-plus-write floor rather than the write-only
tier, which is not recoverable from the list itself. Read them before adding,
moving or removing an entry.

Layered internally. Layer one is declarations, predicates, the bounded resolver
and the public path gates, and it reads nothing else in this package. Layer two is
the command-line orchestrator, :func:`is_sensitive_bash_command`: it composes the
egress tier and the rules catalog, both of which load-import layer one, so it
reaches them through call-time imports in the one body that needs them. The fence
between the two layers is a comment and this module's load-time import list, not
a second file.

The command-line gate does not match paths. Sensitive paths are enforced by the OS
sandbox on the agent's process tree and by :func:`is_sensitive_path` on every
resolved path the file tools open; a regex over the text of a shell command added
no protection on top of those and denied ordinary read-only commands, so the
orchestrator carries only the size ceiling, the IMDS detector and the
environment-credential detector.

The resolver is bounded on purpose. A path check runs synchronously on the event
loop against an agent-supplied token, so a stalled automount under that token
would wedge the gateway. Resolution is therefore off-loaded to a small dedicated
pool with a deadline, and a stall fails CLOSED for every path under the stalled
prefix until the mount answers again.

#
# ``os.path.realpath`` / ``Path.resolve`` ``lstat`` every component of the path
# they are handed.  The path gates hand them AGENT-SUPPLIED tokens -- including
# tokens that name nothing on this host at all, like the remote side of
# ``ssh host 'cd /home/user/ws && ...'`` -- and a component that lands on a
# stalled automount (macOS ``/home`` is an autofs map resolved through
# opendirectoryd; a dead NFS/SSHFS mount; a disconnected mapped drive) blocks in
# the kernel for as long as the mount does.  No exception is raised, so the
# ``except OSError`` around the call never fired: the call simply never
# returned.  Because :func:`is_sensitive_path` runs synchronously inside
# ``on_tool_call`` on the event loop, that was a loop
# wedge and the stall watchdog's dump-then-exit -- ten identical crash dumps on
# a corp macOS during a VPN transition, the loop parked in ``_joinrealpath`` for
# the full watchdog budget.  Widening the budget only moved the crash.
#
# So resolution runs on its own tiny pool and the caller waits a BOUNDED time.
# A timeout is NOT treated like the ``OSError`` fallback (lexical forms only):
# that would make the degraded state a lever -- stall one token under a wedged
# mount and, for the cooldown, a workspace symlink into a credential store
# would pass on its lexical spelling.  A path whose canonical form cannot be
# established is instead REFUSED (:class:`PathResolutionStalled`, fail-closed
# in every gate), the same posture the rest of this module takes when a proof
# is missing.  The cost is a false refusal of paths under a wedged mount for
# the cooldown window -- the ``ssh`` command above is refused for 30s during a
# VPN transition instead of killing the gateway -- and the refusal names why.
#
# A timeout also opens a short cooldown during which paths under the SAME
# prefix are refused without touching the filesystem: one tool call can
# carry many path tokens against the same wedged mount, each of which would
# otherwise pay the full timeout -- ten tokens at 2s would put the loop back
# past the watchdog.  The cooldown is scoped to the stalled prefix
# (:func:`_stall_prefix`), never process-wide, so a stall on ``/home/<user>``
# leaves ``/tmp`` and the workspace fully resolved.  It doubles on every
# repeat stall under the same prefix (up to the cap below) and a re-probe is
# only attempted while it leaves a worker free, because a timed-out worker is
# NOT reclaimed: a mount that stays dead would otherwise be handed a fresh
# worker every cooldown until every worker is pinned and every healthy path
# queues behind wedged futures -- the per-prefix isolation would hold only
# while free workers remained.

    Separates the two causes of a started-but-unfinished resolution, which the budget alone

    starved of the CPU. Both consume almost no CPU, so a CPU-time comparison cannot tell them
    apart, and neither can the ``/proc`` state field: measured on a 48-core host, a thread doing
    ordinary ``lstat`` work and a thread doing nothing but burn CPU BOTH alternate between ``R``
    and ``S`` from one sample to the next, because a Python thread spends most of its wall time
    waiting on the GIL rather than inside a syscall.

    What does separate them is WHICH syscall the thread is in. A thread genuinely blocked in a
    kernel wait reports that syscall on every sample; one merely contending reports ``futex`` or
    ``running``. And these syscalls complete in microseconds on a healthy filesystem, so
    sampling one at all is itself evidence that it is not completing.

    UNVERIFIED, and deliberately not claimed: that a thread stuck in one of these syscalls on a
    real wedged NFS, FUSE or CIFS mount reports it stably. No wedged mount could be produced
    where this was measured: an unprivileged ``fusermount3`` mount returns EPERM and
    ``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`` returns EPERM, so neither FUSE nor a user-namespace NFS mount is
    available there.

    What IS confirmed is the sampling this rests on, including for the state class a wedged FUSE
    or CIFS mount actually waits in. An ``openat`` on a FIFO with no writer blocks
    INTERRUPTIBLY while operating on a real filesystem path, and measured on a 48-core x86_64
    host it reported state ``S`` with syscall 257 on 15 of 15 samples and no other value -- so

    ``read`` and a ``clock_nanosleep``, each 12 of 12). See
    ``test_an_in_s_filesystem_wait_is_sampled_stably_and_reads_as_blocked``.

    The table covers ``readlink`` as well as the stat family because CPython's
    ``posixpath.realpath`` calls ``os.lstat`` AND ``os.readlink`` per component: a mount that
    answers the lstat from cache and hangs the readlink would otherwise read as not blocked,
    take the load arm, and pay an uncharged full-budget probe per token rather than opening one
    cooldown.

    Fails toward the EXISTING behaviour -- an unreadable ``/proc``, a thread that has already
    exited, an architecture whose syscall numbers are not mapped -- by returning True, so the
    caller still charges the prefix rather than silently withholding an escalation the gate
    would otherwise make.

    The shared core under :func:`_resolved_forms_bounded` (the agent-supplied
    CANDIDATE), :func:`_resolved_root_key` and :func:`_rebuild_targets_bounded`
    (the TARGET anchors: ``$HOME``, the
    override roots and the keystone leaves).  Both kinds of resolution stat the
    same filesystem from the event loop, so they share one pool, one budget and
    one per-prefix cooldown: a stall observed while anchoring ``$HOME`` refuses
    candidate resolution under that prefix for the same window, and a stall on
    a candidate keeps the anchors from re-probing the same wedged mount every
    time the target cache expires.

    Returns the worker's value, or ``None`` when resolution FAILED -- the pool
    refused work at interpreter exit, or faulted.  A resolution that does not
    COMPLETE is different and raises
    :class:`PathResolutionStalled` instead, both on the timing-out call and,
    without touching the filesystem, for every later call under the same
    :func:`_stall_prefix` until the cooldown lapses.  Repeated stalls under one
    prefix double the cooldown up to ``_PATH_RESOLVE_COOLDOWN_MAX_SECS``, and a
    prefix with a stall history is only re-probed while that leaves at least one
    worker free for everything else -- so a permanently dead mount is probed
    rarely and can never pin the whole pool.  Never blocks the caller for longer
    than *budget* plus its grace -- the bounded second wait a missed budget earns
    before the prefix is charged, itself a capped fraction of *budget*. Both waits
    also consume the calling thread's cumulative allowance -- excluding a wait
    below the floor, resolver-pool round-trip overhead rather than filesystem
    latency; exhaustion refuses without submitting work or charging a prefix until
    the quiet window expires.
    Charging the prefix on a timeout ALSO requires that both the budget and the
    grace were granted in full, uncapped by the allowance: a wait clamped short by
    the allowance says nothing about the mount, so it refuses this call alone,
    the same conclusion the saturated-pool, never-ran and load arms reach.

    A stall is charged only to a resolution that RAN.  A future that times out
    still QUEUED (the pool saturated by concurrent callers, e.g. simultaneous
    cron fires) is cancelled and refuses this call alone: queue wait is
    evidence about load, not about the mount, so it opens no cooldown and pins
    no worker in :func:`_wedged_workers`.  A future claimed by a freeing worker
    in the very instant the deadline fires is abandoned by handshake -- the
    worker returns without entering the resolution -- so the never-ran
    classification is binding, not a race.

    The UNC shortcut is NOT here: skipping a ``\\\\server\\share`` token is a
    stance about agent-supplied CANDIDATES (:func:`_resolved_forms_bounded`),
    whose fence targets a UNC realpath never produces.  The anchors are the
    fence itself, and a UNC home with a junction inside ``KIROCREW_HOME`` must
    still be canonicalised or a canonical-spelling request would miss the
    governance file (found in review); the bound makes that probe safe.

    *budget* sizes the wait to the work the caller submits: the anchor REBUILD is
    one job performing ~130 ``realpath`` calls and passes
    ``_PATH_RESOLVE_REBUILD_TIMEOUT_SECS``, while a candidate resolution keeps the
    default. One budget for both put the rebuild ~130x closer to its ceiling than
    the path whose latency the default exists to guarantee.

    Every per-anchor resolved form comes from :func:`_realpath_or_none`, looked
    up at call time so a test can stand in a recording or wedged resolver at
    module level.  It touches the filesystem, so in production this function
    runs on the ``mc-pathres`` pool via :func:`_home_dir_targets` (see there
    for why); only direct callers and tests run it inline.

    *roots* optionally supplies the already-resolved :class:`_ResolvedRoots`
    already resolved by the caller. The TTL cache in :func:`_home_dir_targets` MUST pass
    it: resolving the roots here as well would read the filesystem a second
    time, and a root symlink repointed between the two reads would file this
    set under a key naming the OTHER root — caching one root's targets against
    another root's key, which fails OPEN. ``None`` (direct callers and tests)
    resolves them here as before.

    Anchors against BOTH the logical home and its realpath.  On macOS the
    per-user temp/home prefix can itself be reached via OS symlinks (``/var`` →
    ``/private/var``); folding both roots in means a resolved candidate under
    either spelling is still matched.

    ``home_dirs`` entries are authored with POSIX "/" separators, and some are
    multi-segment now (e.g. ".kiro/crew/security_policy.json"). Split on "/"
    and re-join with ``os.path.join`` so the target uses the running OS's
    separator — otherwise on Windows the target keeps a literal "/" in the
    leaf while the candidate forms (realpath/normpath) are all-backslash, they
    never compare equal, and the keystone would silently stop gating its own
    secrets. On POSIX a single-segment entry splits to a 1-element list, so
    this is a no-op there.

# 3.5s was this rebuild.

# Deliberately TTL-bounded rather than a plain ``lru_cache``: part of the set is
# derived from FILESYSTEM state, so an unbounded cache would keep matching a
# stale target if a symlink were repointed after the cache warmed — a gate that
# fails OPEN. A few seconds bounds that window.
#
# The key is built from the RESOLVED roots (``Path.home().resolve()`` and the
# resolved ``KIROCREW_HOME``), NOT from the raw env vars, because those two
# values are exactly what the builder anchors its targets on. Keying on the raw
# ``$HOME`` string is wrong twice over:
#   1. Repointing a symlink AT ``$HOME`` leaves ``$HOME`` unchanged while every
#      target moves, so the gate returns False for a credential path the
#      uncached code blocks (a real, reproduced bypass — see the regression
#      test ``test_repointed_home_symlink_is_not_served_from_cache``).
#   2. ``Path.home()`` reads ``USERPROFILE`` on Windows and never ``HOME``, so on
#      that platform the key omits the one variable that decides the anchor.
# Resolving the roots costs ~2 realpath calls (~0.06ms) against the ~1.14ms
# rebuild it replaces, so the win survives. Those calls -- and the rebuild
# itself -- run on the ``mc-pathres`` pool under the resolve budget, one thread
# hop each (``_resolved_root_key`` resolves all six roots in one job,
# ``_rebuild_targets_bounded`` resolves every leaf in one job), because
# an inline ``realpath($HOME)`` on a loaded Windows desktop blocked past the
# loop-stall watchdog; see ``_rebuild_targets_bounded``.
#
# Residual, accepted: a symlink swapped DEEPER inside the crew home (an
# individual keystone leaf, or an intermediate directory on the way to one) can
# still be served stale for up to the TTL. Detecting that needs the per-leaf
# realpath calls that ARE the expense — measured 45 realpath calls per build,
# 94% of its 1.39ms — so there is no cheap way to keep the cache and revalidate
# them.
#
# The TTL is therefore sized as small as it can be while still doing its job.
# The value is 0.1s, NOT a "few seconds", because a skills walk issues thousands
# of calls in a burst and one build serves the whole burst either way. Measured
# cold-walk cost against this constant:
#     5.0s -> 0.95s    1.0s -> 0.93s    0.1s -> 0.95s    0.0s -> 4.66s
# So 0.1s keeps the entire win while cutting the stale window 50x versus 5.0s.
# Only 0.0 (no cache) closes the window completely, and that reverts to the 4.7s
# scan whose GIL-held cost wedges the event loop — the defect this exists to fix.

    ``kiro_home`` is the resolved ``KIRO_HOME`` override (kiro-cli's own home
    override, honoured by ``kiro_agents_dir()``), or ``None`` when unset — it
    re-anchors the ``~/.kiro/agents`` write-protection, so a changed ``KIRO_HOME``

    resolved only so a symlinked override keys and anchors identically.

    ``adapter_roots`` does the same for every declared harness credential home in
    ``_OVERRIDE_ANCHORED_LEAVES``.

    ``logical_home`` is ``Path.home()`` UNRESOLVED.  It is a separate anchor, not
    a duplicate: on a host where ``$HOME`` is itself a symlink (``/home/x`` ->
    ``/local/home/x`` on cloud desktops) the resolved home spells every target
    one way while an agent-supplied ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` spells it the other.  The
    resolved CANDIDATE normally bridges that -- but candidate resolution is
    bounded (:func:`_resolved_forms_bounded`) and degrades to the lexical
    spelling, which must still hit a target or the gate fails OPEN on exactly
    the hosts where ``$HOME`` is a link.  Keyed here so an env change that
    moves the logical spelling invalidates the cache like any other anchor.

    ``os_home`` is the resolved ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` override, or ``None`` when
    unset. It is an ALTERNATE ``$HOME``: ``pod.runtime.build_pod_env`` sets it
    and ``acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap`` makes it the literal ``HOME`` of a
    pod-spawned kiro-cli child, so kiro-cli's own ``$HOME``-derived credential
    store — the runtime identity store ``pod.runtime._seed_pod_os_home`` mirrors
    in, and the MCP OAuth grants that pod's own child MINTS under
    ``.aws/sso/cache`` — lives under this root rather than under the real home.
    No host SSO cache contents are copied in; that staging was removed. Anchoring
    it here is what fences the relocated tree, and it is the ONLY layer that can:
    the pod child's mount namespace must keep that tree readable AND writable
    because kiro-cli writes its grants there and no env lever relocates them. So
    the two audiences are split — the harness process reaches the tree, while an
    agent TOOL call naming any path under it is refused in-band here. Every
    ``home_dirs`` entry is re-anchored under it, not merely ``.aws``, because
    the variable relocates the whole home: the crew-home leaves, ``.ssh`` and
    every other fenced entry move with it. Same reasoning as the
    ``KIROCREW_HOME`` expansion below — an override must not move a secret out

    candidate checked AGAINST it.  They are deliberately NOT ``realpath``'d
    inline on the event loop every time the 0.1s cache expires: on a Windows
    desktop under heavy disk load (a full test run plus several subagents, all

    25s loop-stall watchdog from inside ``on_tool_call``, and the gateway exits
    with every in-flight turn -- the same crash the bounded candidate
    resolution already prevents for the OTHER half of the check.

    The whole rebuild is ONE pool job, not one per leaf: a single bash command
    can drive ~200 rebuilds (``test_chained_cd_expansions_do_not_blow_up_the_gate``),
    and 40 thread hops per rebuild is what turns a 9s gate into a 15s one.  The

    single job does ~130 ``realpath`` calls where a candidate resolution does one or
    two: sharing the candidate's budget sized the wait to the wrong work and let an
    ordinarily-slow rebuild on a loaded host read as a stalled mount.

    A rebuild that does not complete canonically within the budget RAISES, and

    :func:`_resolved_root_key` (see the comment there for the three weaker
    fallbacks review found open: lexical spellings, a UNC skip, and serving the

    about tokens, not about the fence.  The stall is recorded, so the rebuild
    does not re-probe the wedged mount every 0.1s -- it refuses without touching
    the filesystem until the cooldown lapses.

    ``sub/cfg.ini`` resolves against the real directory rather than whatever CWD
    the gateway process happens to have.  Absolute inputs are unaffected;
