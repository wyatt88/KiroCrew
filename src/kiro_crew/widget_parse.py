"""Extract ``<mcwidget>`` spans from assistant text (Python port of the frontend parser).

This is the backend half of a two-language pair. The frontend
(``website/src/hooks/useBlockAssembler.ts`` -> ``parseBlocks``) splits a chat
message into blocks and assigns each widget block a 0-based ``widgetIndex``;
``WidgetFrame`` then derives its artifact slug from ``(message_ts, widgetIndex)``.
The backend auto-registers widget artifacts at message-finalize time and must
compute the SAME indices, or every registered artifact lands on a slug the
frontend never looks up.

So this module deliberately mirrors ``parseBlocks``'s widget detection rather
than using a simpler regex:

- Tags are matched per line, **after** inline-code spans are masked, so a
  ``<mcwidget>`` quoted in backticks while documenting the syntax is not
  extracted as a real widget.
- A fenced code block outside a widget swallows widget tags (they are literal
  code, not markup).
- A fence *inside* a widget body keeps the body opaque: a ``</mcwidget>`` inside
  that fence does not close the widget until the fence closes.
- An unterminated widget at end of input **is** emitted. This mirrors
  ``parseBlocks``'s ``flushWidget(!streaming)``: on final text the frontend marks
  such a widget ``complete: true`` and renders a real ``WidgetFrame`` for it (only
  a *streaming* partial gets the placeholder). Dropping it here would leave a
  rendered widget with no artifact behind it — the parity test caught exactly
  this.

Only ``streaming=False`` semantics are implemented: the backend only ever parses
final, complete message text (a streaming partial has no stable identity to
register yet).

``test/test_widget_parse.py`` and ``website/src/test/widgetSlug.test.ts`` share
the same fixture strings so drift between the two parsers fails both suites.

# ── Character classes: mirror the frontend EXACTLY ──────────────────────────
#
# The frontend regexes these mirror use JS `\w` and `\s`, which are ASCII-only
# (`\w` == [A-Za-z0-9_]). Python's `\w`/`\s` are UNICODE-aware, so writing the
# visually identical pattern here makes the two parsers disagree on non-ASCII
# input — and because a widget's artifact slug is keyed by its INDEX, a
# disagreement doesn't just misparse, it binds the wrong artifact to the widget.
#
# The fence-open rule is the CommonMark one, on both sides: the info string is
# anything after the backtick run that contains no backtick, and the tag is its
# first run of non-space characters. `FENCE_OPEN` in ``useBlockAssembler.ts``
# spells it `[^`\s]*` + `[^`]*`; here JS `\s` is spelled out as ``_JS_SPACE``
# (`\s` diverges in BOTH directions — Python matches U+001C-U+001F and U+0085,
# which JS does not; JS matches U+FEFF, which Python does not). So a fence
# tagged ```例, ```error-report or ```c++ opens on both sides, and a fence line
# ending in one of those characters closes on both sides.
#
# Which lines count as a fence decides widget INDICES. A message that has a
# widget inside a fence tagged ```c++, ```js {1,3} or ```例, followed by a real
# widget, indexes the real widget at 0 under this rule and at 1 under a `\w`
# rule. Slugs are derived once, at emission (chat_runner registers
# ``derive_widget_slug(message_ts, index)``), and are not re-derived for
# history on the backend; the frontend re-derives on every render and probes
# the artifact store by that slug. For such a message stored under the `\w`
# rule, the probe therefore misses (star shows unsaved) and a save creates a
# fresh artifact under the current index, while the stored artifact stays
# intact in the library. That shift is a one-time cost of one shared rule,
# accepted over carrying two parsers; widgets emitted under this rule are
# stable.
