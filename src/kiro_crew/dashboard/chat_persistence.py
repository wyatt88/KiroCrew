    """Was *history_key* deleted (or deleted-and-recreated) during a prefetch?

    Returns a short reason for logging, or ``None`` when it is safe to build.

    Offloading a transcript read opens a window an atomic on-loop read-then-build
    does not have: ``ConversationLog.delete_session``
    leaves **no tombstone** — its own docstring notes that once the delete
    releases the lock "a concurrent writer can recreate the session" — so a slot
    published from content we already hold rewrites, on its next flush, a file
    the user permanently deleted. The dashboard's HTTP listener is bound before
    startup restore runs (``_start_site`` precedes it in ``start_dashboard``), so
    a user delete really can land inside this window.

    This is the guard the chat-resume handler already applies after its own read
    for exactly this reason; the logic is mirrored here rather than reinvented, so
    both surfaces refuse on the same evidence.

    MUST be called synchronously, on the loop, with no suspension point between
    it and the build it gates — an await in between would reopen the window it
    closes.

    Two arms, and the asymmetry in each is deliberate:

    * **absence** — ``get_metadata_status``, never ``get_metadata``: the latter
      returns ``{}`` for both "deleted" and "unreadable", and reading an
      unreadable metadata line as a deletion would discard a LIVE session. On an
      unreadable read this returns ``None`` (build), because refusing is the
      destructive direction here.
    * **identity** — the delete leaves no tombstone, so a delete-then-RECREATE
      inside the window leaves a NON-EMPTY metadata dict belonging to a NEW
      conversation. Existence alone reads that as "still here" and would publish
      a slot holding the OLD transcript, whose flush overwrites a session the
      user is actively using — worse than the first arm, because the data
      destroyed is live. ``created_at`` is the discriminator: every path that
      MINTS a metadata line stamps it, while a rewrite/compaction carries it
      through verbatim, so this does not fire on a legitimate rewrite.

    ``created_at`` ABSENT on either side falls through to building rather than
    refusing: refusing would reject every transcript whose metadata predates the
    field, a visible break for real users, to close a narrow race.

    The existence witness is the UNION of the pre-read metadata and the
    transcript, so a metadata-only session (a metadata line with no messages,
    which ``update_metadata`` creates on upsert) is not silently unguarded.

    """:func:`restore_open_slots`, with the disk reads off the loop.

    Restoring a tab reads and redacts a transcript, so a user with many large
    tabs can spend tens of seconds in here. Doing that synchronously monopolizes
    the event loop — and because ``_loop_heartbeat`` pets the
    ``LoopStallWatchdog`` *from a coroutine*, a blocked loop cannot pet it. The
    watchdog's 25s ``exit_after`` timer then fires, dumps thread stacks and
    ``_exit``s the gateway, which is exactly the observed startup crash-loop: the
    app never finished booting.

    Yielding between tabs (the ``sleep(0)`` below) was the first fix and is kept:
    it bounds how long any ONE tab can hold the loop. But it only ever moved the
    boundary — the whole per-tab read still ran ON the loop, so a single large
    transcript could stall it for seconds before the next yield arrived. So the
    reads themselves now move: ``open_slots.json``, the agent→model map, and each
    tab's metadata + chained transcript walk are hoisted into
    ``asyncio.to_thread``, and only the slot mutation stays here.

    That mutation cannot follow them. Creating a slot broadcasts via
    ``asyncio.Queue.put_nowait`` / ``asyncio.Event.set``, neither of which is
    thread-safe, and ``_spawn_ws_send``'s ``ensure_future`` raises off-loop into
    a broad ``except`` that marks every connected dashboard client dead and drops
    it *without a close frame* — browsers then never reconnect. So this driver
    runs its own prefetch-then-apply loop (the shape
    ``rehydrate_slot_from_history_async`` established) rather than driving
    :func:`_restore_open_slots_steps`, whose reads are inline by construction.
    The generator stays for the synchronous callers.

    Because this yields, the 5s periodic flush (already running by this point)
    can interleave — so ``restoring_open_slots`` is held for the duration to stop
    it snapshotting a half-restored slot set over open_slots.json.

    """:func:`_rehydrate_slot_from_history` with the disk reads off the loop.

    Same contract and return values as the synchronous form, including
    returning ``None`` for a session the user closed with ✕.

    Why split rather than simply wrapping the whole thing in
    ``asyncio.to_thread``: slot construction is loop-affine. It reaches
    ``get_or_create_slot`` → ``push_slots_update`` → ``_broadcast``, which uses
    ``asyncio.Queue.put_nowait`` and ``Event.set`` — neither thread-safe — and
    ``_spawn_ws_send``'s ``ensure_future`` raises off-loop. That raise lands in
    a broad ``except`` that marks every connected dashboard client dead and
    drops it *without a close frame*, so browsers never reconnect and stop
    receiving frames until a manual reload. ``restore_open_slots_async``
    documents the same invariant.

    So only the reads move: the metadata line, the chained message walk (tens of
    MB of read plus JSON parse on a large session) and the agent→model map.
    Everything that touches slot state runs on the loop, as the synchronous
    callers do. The reads are shared with the two bulk restore drivers via
    :func:`_prefetch_rehydrate_inputs`, so all three prefetch identically.

    Because the read is offloaded, the state it observed can be stale by the time
    the build runs. Both post-hop windows are re-checked below, synchronously and
    immediately before the build so no await can reopen them: the close tombstone
    (a ✕ during the read) and :func:`_deletion_during_read` (the session deleted,
    or deleted and recreated, during the read). Returning ``None`` for either is
    part of the contract — the callers already handle a ``None`` result.

# Memoisation for :func:`_build_message_entry`. ``_save_slot_to_history``
# re-serializes the WHOLE in-memory window on every flush (see the comment inside
# the uncached builder), so each save re-runs redaction over every message in the
# window -- including the overwhelming majority that have not changed since the
# previous flush. Redaction is the expensive part: two passes over the content,
# the same two passes again over EACH variant, plus a meta pass.
#
# The key is a content hash of the WHOLE message rather than an identity or a
# field subset, which is what makes invalidation automatic and total: the slot
# mutates messages in place (a stop event resolving, a file-change chip landing,
# a banner completing), and any such edit changes the digest, so the next call
# misses and recomputes instead of serving a stale entry. There is deliberately
# no explicit invalidation hook to forget.
#
# Bound sizing: a save re-serializes one slot's entire window, so the live
# working set is roughly ``active_slots x window_size`` and the failure mode past
# the bound is a cliff rather than a slope -- each save walks its window in
# order, so with several slots taking turns the LRU evicts each window just
# before its next save and the hit rate collapses to zero instead of degrading.
# The default entry bound holds several concurrent slot windows; because the
# right size is host-dependent (a gateway with many active slots overflows the
# entry bound while the byte bound still has headroom), both the entry bound and
# the byte ceiling are configurable
# (``dashboard.chat_entry_cache_max_entries`` / ``chat_entry_cache_max_bytes``).
#
# The flush site skips the cache for a window longer than the entry bound, which
# closes that cliff for ONE oversized window and nothing more. Several slots
# whose COMBINED windows exceed the bound each stay under it individually, so
# they take the cached path and hit the same zero-hit cliff unguarded. Detecting
# that needs a live view across slots, which no single save has; the mitigation
# is the configurable entry bound above -- an operator whose host shows the
# multi-slot cliff raises it -- while the cost of the residual case is only the
# key derivation on a miss.
#
# The entry count alone does NOT bound memory, because an entry is as large as
# its message: a cache full of megabyte-sized messages would retain gigabytes.
# That retention outlives the slot, since the entry holds the SAME content string
# object as the message rather than a copy, so a closed slot's window can be
# freed while the cache keeps its content alive. Hence two further bounds: a
# per-entry ceiling above which an entry is computed but never stored (so one
# huge message cannot evict the whole cache), and a total-byte ceiling evicted
# alongside the entry count. Worst-case retention is the lesser of
# ``max_entries x _ENTRY_MAX_CACHEABLE_BYTES`` and the configured byte ceiling.
#
# Size is measured as the length of the key payload, which the front door has
# already built for hashing, so it costs nothing extra. It measures the input
# rather than the built entry, but the entry is derived from it and the two track
# each other within a small factor -- accurate enough for a memory ceiling.
#
# Two properties work in our favour: entries are content-keyed, so two slots
# holding identical message content share one entry; and a cached ``None`` (a
# transient role) is a legitimate value, so membership -- not truthiness -- is
# what distinguishes a hit from a miss.

    """Return ``(frozen_prefix, foreign_lines, dedup_dropped)`` for a save.

    ``frozen_prefix`` is the verbatim bytes of the first *disk_older* on-disk
    message lines — the turns OLDER than the in-memory window. They are never
    rewritten, so older history survives a restart that only loaded a recent
    window. The bytes are cached on the slot keyed by ``(mtime, size,
    disk_older)`` so a steady 5s flush is O(window) rather than O(file size).

    ``foreign_lines`` are on-disk message lines in the WINDOW region (the bytes
    after the frozen prefix) that this slot's in-memory *window_entries* do NOT
    represent — i.e. acknowledged appends made by ANOTHER process (subagent /
    cron / CLI) that this slot never saw. ``_save_slot_to_history`` captures its
    ``window`` snapshot BEFORE taking ``_locked``, so a cross-process writer can
    fully append + release between the snapshot and this save acquiring the lock;
    a bare ``meta + frozen + window`` replace would then silently delete that
    acknowledged message. Carrying these lines into the payload makes the save
    non-destructive against cross-process appends. Identity is **id-first**: a
    disk line whose ``meta.mid`` (read via :func:`row_mid`) matches a window
    entry's id, corroborated by body or ``ts`` (same ``(role, content)`` — a
    durable copy — or same ``ts`` — an in-place edit), IS that entry's
    persisted copy, so it is dropped silently (the window re-serializes it)
    and never archived. The corroboration is required because ``meta.mid`` is
    caller-suppliable (``_ChatSlot.append`` preserves a pre-existing id), so a
    bare id equality could pair two genuinely distinct messages; an id match
    with NO corroborating entry falls back to the legacy ladder as if id-less,
    which typically preserves the line. A disk line whose ``meta.mid`` matches
    NO available window entry is a foreign append regardless of body equality,
    which is what tells two genuinely distinct identical-content messages
    apart — it still keeps its ``ts`` group ambiguous for the ts-only tier, so
    its presence can never convert a contested group into a silent id-less
    fold. Only an **id-less** disk line resolves
    through the legacy timestamp-first ladder, unchanged: it is treated as
    ours when
    its ``ts`` matches a window entry (covers in-place edits, which keep ``ts``
    but change content) OR — as a COUNT-BOUNDED tiebreak — its
    ``(role, content)`` matches an as-yet-unconsumed window entry (covers a
    same-process ``append_if_absent`` copy persisted with a FRESH ``ts``
    distinct from the window entry's in-memory ``ts``). The tiebreak is bounded
    so each window entry absorbs AT MOST ONE disk copy: if the on-disk window
    region holds two id-less lines with identical ``(role, content)`` but
    distinct timestamps — the window's own persisted copy PLUS a genuinely
    distinct event from another process (e.g. a repeated identical cron /
    workflow result) — only the first is folded into the window and the second
    is preserved as a foreign append. A plain ``(role, content)`` set collapsed
    those two real events into one; the bounded, timestamp-first identity
    fixes it for id-less lines, and the ``meta.mid`` tier resolves it exactly
    for stamped lines (see also ``docs/system-specs/modules/history.md``).
    ``dedup_dropped`` returns any fresh-``ts`` content-tiebreak drops so the
    caller can route them through the archive — even the residual ambiguous
    case (an id-less distinct message indistinguishable from an
    ``append_if_absent`` copy without a stable id) then loses no data
    permanently. A corroborated id-matched fold is NOT such a drop: the ids
    plus body/``ts`` agreeing makes it unambiguous, so it does not churn the
    archive.

    Fast path: when BOTH the on-disk mtime AND size match the frozen-prefix
    cache, THIS slot was the last writer and nothing has landed since, so the
    prefix is served from cache and the foreign lines preserved by the previous
    save are re-emitted verbatim from cache — the O(file) read/scan runs ONLY
    when the file changed on disk since our last write. Size is part of the key
    because an append always grows the file even inside a single coarse mtime
    tick, so mtime alone is not a safe change signal for a data-loss guard.
    Re-emitting the cached foreign lines (rather than assuming there are none)
    is what makes the fast path non-destructive: a previous save may have
    preserved a cross-process append INTO the on-disk window region, and since
    ``disk_older`` is unchanged those preserved lines would otherwise be dropped
    by a bare frozen-prefix + in-memory-window rebuild on the very next save.

    The session file is modeled as **frozen prefix + live window**:

    - The **frozen prefix** is the first ``slot._disk_older_count`` on-disk
      message lines — the turns OLDER than the in-memory window (set at
      restore/resume). These bytes are read verbatim and NEVER rewritten, so a
      restart that loaded only a recent window can no longer destroy older
      history.
    - The **live window** is ``slot.messages`` (small, ~500 messages). It is
      re-serialized in full on every save. Re-serializing the whole window means
      in-place edits to already-shown messages (stop-event resolution, file-change
      chips, mcp_oauth banner completion) and any reordering done by
      ``_flush_segment`` all persist correctly — there is no position counter to
      get out of sync.

    The default save writes ``meta + frozen_prefix + serialize(window)``.

    Pass ``rewrite=True`` (or an explicit *messages* snapshot, which implies it)
    for operations that INTENTIONALLY truncate the window (rewind/regenerate/
    fork): the file is rebuilt as ``meta + frozen_prefix + serialize(snapshot)``
    and the dropped window tail is archived first via ``_archive_dropped_lines``.

    Concurrency: ``_flush_dirty_slots`` runs this in an executor thread
    while ``_run_chat`` mutates ``slot.messages`` on the event loop. We snapshot
    ``list(slot.messages)`` (a single GIL-atomic attribute read) and the matching
    ``slot._disk_older_count`` up front, then operate only on that snapshot, so a
    concurrent ``_flush_segment`` reassigning ``slot.messages`` cannot interleave
    with the read-serialize-write and skip/duplicate a message.

    Operates ONLY on this slot's own single session file (``_path(history_key)``);
    tab_id chaining is 1:1 (a slot's tab_id maps to exactly one file — fork makes
    a fresh slot with its own file), so this never reads/writes a sibling and
    legacy no-tab_id sessions stay isolated.

    ``rows_only``: persist the window but leave the metadata line's slot-owned
    fields as they are on disk, keeping authority over only
    :data:`~kiro_crew.history.ROWS_ONLY_OWNED_META_KEYS`. It exists for the one
    caller whose slot is not the transcript's only writer: the close/cleanup
    hand-over drain, which writes a popped slot's unsaved rows onto a transcript a
    concurrent same-key replacement now holds. The default rebuild would revert
    whatever that replacement had already published (a folder or a pinned title
    from ``POST /api/chat/slots``, a tag, a pin), so the rows move and the line does
    not. The deferred set is
    :data:`~kiro_crew.history.ROWS_ONLY_DEFERRED_META_KEYS`, which is wider than the
    owned fields alone: a title's provenance and refresh budget describe the title
    and travel with it. It includes ``closed``/``closed_at``, so an open-shaped
    rows-only write does not erase a dismissal the replacement committed while this
    one was in flight.

    The deferral is conditional on there being another writer to defer to, decided
    from the line's ``tab_id``: a line this slot published itself, or no line at
    all, gets the ordinary rebuild. Otherwise the flag would cost the popped slot
    its own uncommitted metadata — an edit is acknowledged when it lands in memory
    and persists on a later flush, and after the pop no flush ever visits that slot
    again.

    ``expected_disk_older_count`` pairs an explicit *messages* snapshot with the
    ``slot._disk_older_count`` the caller observed in the SAME synchronous stretch
    it froze that snapshot in. A snapshot is internally consistent by
    construction, but the frozen-prefix boundary it must be written against is
    not: a concurrent ``append`` at the window cap trims the front and credits
    the trimmed rows to ``_disk_older_count``, so a snapshot frozen before that
    trim, written against the counter read after it, emits those rows twice —
    once in the frozen prefix and once at the head of the snapshot. Supplying the
    paired count makes that drift refuse the save (``False``, nothing written)
    instead of committing a duplicated transcript; a caller that reads the live
    counter itself cannot detect the drift at all. Ignored without *messages*,
    where the bounded retry below already takes both halves together.

    Returns ``False`` when the delete-won guard aborted the save because the
    session was permanently deleted while this save awaited the lock, when
    ``expected_history_key`` no longer matches the slot's routing, or when
    ``expected_disk_older_count`` drifted — the in-memory window was NOT
    persisted and must not be treated as durable. Every other completion
    (including the benign no-op skips) returns ``True``.

    This helper mirrors :func:`~kiro_crew.history.append_off_loop`: on a running
    loop it dispatches the save to a worker thread so it takes the *patient*
    off-loop acquire path; off the loop it saves inline.

    ``best_effort`` (default ``True``): a lock timeout / I/O error is logged and
    the slot is marked ``_dirty`` so the periodic flush retries the write — the
    in-memory slot is the source of truth. This retry re-arm matters for the
    metadata mutation endpoints (pin / folder / tag / mode), which call this with
    ``force=True`` but do not otherwise mark the slot dirty: without it a
    swallowed failure would drop an acknowledged edit with no retry, losing it
    after a restart. Pass ``best_effort=False`` for archival paths (session
    close/cleanup) that must CONFIRM the durable write succeeded before removing
    the session: the save still runs off-loop (patient acquire), but any
    exception propagates so the caller can roll back and keep the slot.

    ``expected_history_key``: the transcript key the caller authorized its
    mutation against. The save refuses (returns ``False``, nothing written)
    when the slot's routing no longer resolves to that key at write time -- a
    rebind on the event loop can land between the caller's authorization and
    the worker's routing snapshot, and without this pin the durable write
    would target a transcript the caller never authorized.

    ``rows_only``: write the window but leave the metadata line's slot-owned
    fields as they stand on disk when the line was published by ANOTHER slot --
    for a caller persisting a slot's rows onto a transcript another live slot now
    holds. See :func:`_save_slot_to_history` for the full contract, including the
    ``tab_id`` test that keeps the flag from deferring to the caller's own line.

    Returns ``False`` only when the save was skipped WITHOUT writing: the
    session was permanently deleted while the save awaited the lock (the
    delete-won guard in :func:`_save_slot_to_history`), or the routing moved
    off ``expected_history_key``. Neither skip raises, for either
    ``best_effort`` mode, so a clean return does NOT prove a committed write.
    Callers that go on to republish the slot's content elsewhere (fork, the
    transfer export) must check the return; archival callers (close/cleanup)
    may ignore it — the delete already disposed of what they were archiving.
