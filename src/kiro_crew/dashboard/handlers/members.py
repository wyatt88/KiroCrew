"""Crew Members HTTP handlers — roster and per-member DM thread binding.

The Crew Members page talks to each crew member in one durable, pinned DM
thread. The thread's slot key is DERIVED (``member-<slug>``) and its binding
lives in the member's own space (``members/<slug>/dm.json``), so the mapping
survives restarts independently of the slot layer's own persistence.

Member slots are born ONLY here, with ``mode="member"``: the generic slot
create endpoint's ``_CREATABLE_MODES`` deliberately excludes it, and the
frontend's chat-ownership predicate (``isChatPageSurface``) does not admit it,
which is what keeps member threads out of the ordinary Sessions list with no
filtering code anywhere.

Dashboard-only surface: app tokens are denied outright (deny-by-default, same
posture as slot access — an app has no business enumerating the user's crews
or opening threads that speak as them).

    """POST /api/members — hire a crew member from a local Custom Agent file.

    The one hire verb of the wrapper design, source ``local`` (the "adopt"
    path). Body::

        {"source": {"kind": "local", "agent": "reviewer"},  # installed agent file
         "display_name": "Checkout triage",          # optional: what you call them
         "role": "Oncall Triage Engineer",           # optional job title
         "workspace": "default", "triggers": "", "session_color": ""}  # optional

    **Zero-config**: a hire needs nothing but its source. Without a
    ``display_name`` the member is named after its ``role`` (or, with no role
    either, after the source file) and the row records ``named_by_user:
    false`` -- the thread header then says *Just hired · named after its role*
    and offers the rename in place. A defaulted name may collide; the create
    then suffixes the id (``role-2``) and the label (``Role #2``) instead of
    answering 409, since there is no user to hand the 409 to.

    ATOMIC: the member either exists with its own copy of the source, or does
    not exist at all -- and at no moment is a row bound to the SHARED source
    readable. Three steps:

    1. **Resolve the source** before anything is written: an agent name that
       matches no installed file is a 404 here, not a member bound to nothing.
    2. **Copy-on-hire.** Inside the create's config-lock hold, before the row
       exists, the source definition is copied into a member-owned agent file
       (``name`` = the copy's stem, derived from the minted member id) through
       the same private-copy writer the crew editor's first-edit fork uses.
       Lineage lands in the agent_state sidecar, so the fork refresh keeps the
       copy's machine-maintained plumbing current.
    3. **Publish the wrapper row** through the same validated create path
       ``POST /api/agents`` uses -- the id is minted from ``display_name``,
       private memory is provisioned -- ALREADY bound to the copy.

    The copy comes first because a row bound to the shared source, even for
    the moment between a create and a fork, is a row a concurrent thread open
    can resolve and run a session against, and that session would keep using
    the shared template after the hire completed -- the exact hazard this
    verb exists to remove. A source that vanished between 1 and 2 answers 404
    with nothing written; a row that fails to persist after the copy unwinds
    the copy (file and lineage). A caller wanting a shared binding has
    ``POST /api/agents``.

    Two members hired from one file therefore coexist: each owns its own copy
    and its own row.
