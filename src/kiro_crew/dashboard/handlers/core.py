    persist the sentinel and destroy the real secret (e.g. ``telegram.bot_token``).
    Safe here because no config write endpoint accepts sensitive fields; if one
    is ever added it MUST treat ``_SENSITIVE_MASK`` as "unchanged" and keep the
    stored value. Sensitivity is schema-driven (``sensitive=True`` field
    metadata), so newly added sensitive fields are masked automatically.

    Two masking passes. The schema walk covers owner-stored secrets
    (``sensitive=True``). A second pass covers agent-record free text
    (``_AGENT_UNTRUSTED_TEXT_FIELDS``): those values are agent- and
    package-writable, so a credential- or exfiltration-URL-shaped one is
    masked wholesale (``_mask_agent_free_text``) instead of shipping to the
    browser verbatim. The write-side note above holds for this pass too:
    neither branch of this endpoint can echo the mask into storage — the
    PATCH allowlist (``_EDITABLE_CONFIG``) names no ``agents.*`` path, and
    the PUT branch reads only the singular ``agent`` section against a
    hardcoded key list. The agents CRUD route is the write path for these
    fields; its read pair is ``GET /api/agents``, which ships them verbatim —
    that half of the class needs the same mask plus a mask-means-unchanged
    write rule this endpoint does not need. Named cost of the wider field set: the overview's config tab renders
    ``kiro_agent``/``workspace``/``memory_store`` and cross-references the
    latter two against the workspace and store lists, so a masked value breaks
    that "used by" row — but only for a record whose value is already

    * **Shutdown requested** — when SIGTERM/SIGINT or ``POST /api/shutdown``
      sets the process-wide ``shutdown_event``, readiness changes to 503 while
      ``/api/live`` remains 200 until the HTTP server exits. Supervisors that
      poll during this interval can stop routing new work; this endpoint does
      not itself impose or promise a minimum load-balancer drain delay.

    Shutdown takes precedence over subsystem checks. The response carries only
    fixed, low-cardinality booleans/markers — no paths, ids, counts, secrets, or
    user/session content. The probe paths are exempt from the host_validation
    middleware (orchestrators address pods by IP — see origin.PROBE_PATHS), so
    a disallowed-Host request CAN reach this handler; the detail fields
    (startup/shutdown/subsystem markers) are therefore gated on ``check_host``,
    mirroring ``_liveness_payload``. A disallowed-Host caller gets only
    ``{"ready": bool}`` — exactly the bit the status code already tells it.

    correct containment behaviour -- it is what stops ``..`` from escaping the

    is really a malformed request, so it is translated here instead.

    The predicate is imported rather than restated: this must refuse exactly the
    set the path join refuses, no wider (a narrower guard would break the ``:``
    in a real key like ``dashboard:slot-3``) and no narrower (a wider one puts

    400 with an ``invalid_<name>`` ``code`` -- the contract
    docs/system-specs/common/code-style.md requires of a backend-owned error body.

    ``agent_id`` is checked second because that is the order the sinks validate
    in, so the reported code names the half the caller must actually fix.

    ``is_valid_id`` is imported at module scope per AUTOSDE ``top-level-imports``
