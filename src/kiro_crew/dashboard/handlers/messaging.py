    The egress twin of ``api_delete_message``: same "the bot's own message"

    ``api_send_message``'s — ``redact_for_display`` over the text and
    ``_sanitize_blocks`` over the blocks, before either reaches Slack.

    Authorization is per target kind. A ROOM must be in the tracked-channel
    allowlist, which is the operator's revocation lever rather than only a
    first-contact check — without it a message the bot authored while the channel
    was tracked would stay a writable slot in it after the operator revoked egress.

    ``open_dm(owner_id)`` the send path uses, and fails closed when no owner is
    configured or the lookup raises. Admitting every ``D`` channel on its prefix
    would leave a FORMER owner's DM permanently writable, since ``owner_id``
    changes and the DM channel id does not.

    That is one notch stricter than the ``file_send`` Slack leg
    (``dashboard/upload_destination.py::resolve_slack``), which still passes DMs on
    the prefix. Deliberate: this endpoint publishes replacement content into a
    message that is already there, so a wrong audience is not merely a new message

# Same two-credential shape as WeCom: FEISHU_APP_ID + FEISHU_APP_SECRET live in
# config_dir/.env (0600), non-secret config (enabled, allowed_open_ids,
# allow_group, allowed_group_ids, soft_threshold_pct, session_folder) lives in
# config.json under the "feishu" key. GET returns masked previews + presence
# booleans; raw values are write-only. The UI maps FEISHU_APP_SECRET onto the
# shared panel's primary secret ("bot_token") and FEISHU_APP_ID onto its second
# credential field ("bot_id").
#
# Group access is a SEPARATE axis from the DM allow-list here (unlike WeCom's
# allow-all switch): allow_group gates group chats at all, and allowed_group_ids
# names which ones. Both fail closed — allow_group with an empty list serves no
# group, which is why the panel shows a hint rather than silently doing nothing.


# Channels whose SDK ships as an optional extra rather than in core. Maps the
# channel to (import name, extra name) so the panel can report BOTH whether the
# SDK is importable by this gateway process and the exact command that installs
# it into this interpreter. Teams (PyJWT) and WhatsApp (neonize) have the same
# shape and are one entry each when their panels adopt the card.
