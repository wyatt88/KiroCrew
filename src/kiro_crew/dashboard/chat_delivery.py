"""Delivery of a user message into a chat slot, independent of the caller.

The interesting cases are all in the bookkeeping: a mid-turn steer has to be
registered before the RPC suspends, the transcript segment has to be cut at the
steer boundary, and a steer the live client refuses must fall through to the
queue rather than vanish. Held here rather than inside the route handler so the
bookkeeping can be tested against a slot directly, without an HTTP request, and
so a second delivery caller inherits it rather than growing a second copy that
drifts until a message is silently dropped.

The helpers own that bookkeeping and nothing else — no HTTP, no request parsing,
no response shaping — so a caller layers its own authorization and response
format on top.

    The running turn's teardown drains the queue, so this is how a message
    reaches a busy slot when steering is unavailable or not asked for.

    *send_id* is the client-minted ``meta.sendId`` the plain send path persists
    on its user row, already passed through ``normalize_send_id`` by the caller.
    When present it is stamped onto the queue entry's meta: the drain unions
    every consumed entry's meta onto the row it writes, so this is what gives a
    QUEUED send's row the same ``meta.sendId`` a dispatched send's row gets --
    without it the drained row is id-less and a client that sent into a busy
    slot has no identity to prove its own delivery by (it would have to fall
    back to text, which a same-text resend or an injection can share). Additive:
    a send whose POST carried no usable id stores nothing here and the entry
    meta keeps the exact prior shape.

    *attachments* is the client's ordered attachment lists (``files``, ``dirs``),
    already reduced to lists of strings by ``attachment_meta``. Same reasoning
    as the id: a dispatched send persists ``meta.files`` on its row, and the
    renderer resolves each ``[attached_file N] path`` marker LOSSLESSLY against
    that list. A queued send's row had no such list, so the renderer fell back
    to a whitespace-bounded capture of the marker text and a path with a space
    (``/tmp/My Report.pdf``) came back as ``/tmp/My`` -- an attachment card that
    opens nothing. Stamping the lists onto the entry rides them onto the row.
