"""Delivery of a user message into a chat slot, independent of the caller.

The interesting cases are all in the bookkeeping: a mid-turn steer has to be
registered before the RPC suspends, the transcript segment has to be cut at the
steer boundary, and a steer the live client refuses must fall through to the
queue rather than vanish. Held here rather than inside the route handler so the
bookkeeping can be tested against a slot directly, without an HTTP request, and
so a second delivery caller inherits it rather than growing a second copy that
drifts until a message is silently dropped.

The helpers own that bookkeeping and nothing else — no HTTP, no request parsing,
no response shaping — so a caller layers its own authorization and response
format on top.
