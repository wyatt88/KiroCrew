#
# `more` did NOT fire on util-linux, which has no `+command`. It is listed anyway
# because on the BSDs `more` is not a separate program: FreeBSD's
# `usr.bin/less/Makefile` installs it as a link (`LINKS= ${BINDIR}/less

#
#     git branch injected # --list     -> CREATED the branch
#     git tag forged # --list          -> CREATED the tag
#     git branch injected < --list     -> CREATED the branch

#
# In each case `shlex` supplied a `--list` that put the segment in list mode, so
# the operand walk read `injected` as a pattern instead of a ref to create.
#
# WHY THIS IS PER VERB AND NOT A GLOBAL REFUSAL. A phantom word can only ADD to the
# token list. For a verb decided by its FLAGS, an added word is either inert or gets
# read as a flag it does not have, so the worst case is an extra prompt: safe. Only a
# verb decided by POSITION or MODE can be flipped, because there the count and the
# order of the words carry the decision. Refusing globally cost five ordinary reads
# that no phantom word could have made unsafe (`wc -l < f`, `grep TODO < f`,
# `cat < f`, `wc -l <f`, `head -20 < log.txt`), which is a worse trade than the
# narrower rule.
#
# WHY REFUSE RATHER THAN STRIP THE REDIRECT. Stripping the operator and its target
# looks equivalent and is not: `shlex` has already discarded the quoting, so a token
# beginning with `<` is indistinguishable from a QUOTED argument that begins with
# `<`. Stripping would drop a word bash keeps, and for exactly these verbs that
# opens a hole rather than closing one: `git branch '<new'` reaches `shlex` as
# `[git, branch, <new]`, and dropping `<new` leaves a bare `git branch` that reads
# as a listing while bash creates the ref. Refusing fails closed without
# reimplementing bash's quoting rules, which this module deliberately does not do.

#     `git branch --color newbranch` still creates `newbranch` — while the guard
#     read `newbranch` as the colour and passed the segment.
#   * whether the command is in LIST mode, where an operand is a pattern to match
#     rather than a ref to create. `git branch --list newbranch` lists, it does
#     not create, so treating that operand as a creation would be a false denial.
#

#
# `-d` IS on the list, and the reason it is here is worth recording because an earlier
# revision of this change left it OFF on the belief that BSD/macOS `date -d` sets the
# kernel's daylight-saving value. That belief came from documentation, not from the
# implementations, and checking the implementations showed it is false on every
# platform that ships today. Read from each project's own `getopt(3)` string:
#
#   GNU coreutils      `-d STRING`  parses and PRINTS  (verified by execution, 8.22)
#   FreeBSD  bin/date  "f:I::jnRr:uv:z:"   no `d` at all -> invalid option
#   Apple    shell_cmds/date  "f:I::jnRr:uv:z:"   no `d` at all -> invalid option
#   OpenBSD  bin/date  "af:jr:uz:"         no `d` at all -> invalid option
#   NetBSD   bin/date  "ad:f:jnRr:Uuz:"    `-d` sets rflag and parsedate()s optarg,
#                                          i.e. the GNU meaning: a reference time to
#                                          PRINT. `setthetime()` is reached only from
#                                          a bare operand, never from `-d`.
#
# So `-d` either reads or errors, never writes. The historical `-d dst` that set the
# kernel daylight-saving flag is gone from every current BSD.
#
# There was also an internal tell that should have caught this without the source
# dive: `--date=` was already on the read-only long list, and `-d` is the same option
# under a shorter spelling on every implementation that has it. Admitting one and
# refusing the other could not both be right.
#
# `-s`/`--set` IS the setter GNU shares, verified accepted and failing only on
# privilege ("date: cannot set date: Operation not permitted"). `-f`, `-r`, `-I` and
# `-d` take values, which is what makes `-Iseconds`, `-r FILE` and `-d yesterday` read
# cleanly while `-s` is refused -- the dilemma that kept `-s` out of the old
# write-flag table.

# `file`'s surface, from its own `--help`. It reached an accept-list rather than a
# `-C` denylist entry because that is the shape this change keeps converging on: an
# unlisted option prompts instead of passing, so a flag missing from the help text
# costs a prompt rather than a write. `git blame --textconv` is the reason that
# distinction is not academic.
#
# `-C/--compile` is the setter: with `-m FILE` it compiles that magic file and writes
# `FILE.mgc` beside it (verified, 464 bytes). `-z/--uncompress` is ALSO excluded, on
# the omission-is-cheap principle rather than a measured escape -- libmagic can shell
# out to an external decompressor for formats it does not handle internally, and the
# flag is rare enough that a prompt costs nothing. Everything else prints.
# `f`/`--files-from` is absent, and for a different reason than `-C`: it does not
# write, it INDIRECTS. `file -f LIST` opens every path named inside LIST, and those
# paths never appear in the command, so the hook layer's path gates
# (`is_sensitive_path` / `is_sensitive_bash_command`, applied to the command text) see
# only LIST and cannot see what is actually read. A guard that inspects argv is blind
# to one more level of indirection, so the option has to go rather than the guard get
# cleverer. `sort --files0-from` was already excluded for the same shape; `hostname -F`
# is already refused as a setter.
#
# Kept: `-m/--magic-file`, `-e/--exclude`, `-F/--separator` all take a value, but the
# value IS the path or string being used, visible in argv, so the guards can act on it.
# There is no indirection to hide behind.
#
# `p`/`--preserve-date` is absent too, and it is the subtlest of the three exclusions.
# It LOOKS read-only because it RESTORES the access time rather than setting a caller
# chosen one -- which is how it was originally, and wrongly, admitted here. Restoring
# still requires a `utimes()` call on the named path, and the `ctime` that call bumps is
# NOT restorable. So the option erases the evidence that a file was read while leaving a
# permanent metadata modification behind: the wrong side of read-only in both directions.
#
# MEASURED, because `noatime` on this box hides the atime effect entirely and made the
# obvious test inconclusive. `ctime` advances on any inode metadata write and is visible
# whatever the mount options are:
#
#   file t.txt            -> ctime unchanged   (control)
#   file -b t.txt         -> ctime unchanged   (control)
#   file -p t.txt         -> ctime ADVANCED
#   file --preserve-date  -> ctime ADVANCED
#
# The same probe was then run over every other accept-list flag that opens a named file
# -- `file -m/-k/-L/-s/-r`, `sort`, `sort -u`, `sort -k1`, `date -r`, `date -f`, plus
# `cat` and `wc -l` as controls -- and all twelve are clean. `-p` is the only one.
#
# `-z`/`--uncompress` is also absent, and it belongs to a class this module already
# names elsewhere rather than to the write-flag class. From `file`'s own
# `src/compress.c`, the decompressor is SPAWNED:
#
#     status = posix_spawnp(&pid, compr[method].argv[0], &fa, NULL, ...)
#
# with `compr[]` holding `"gzip"`, `"bzip2"`, `"lzip"`, `"xz"`, `"lrzip"`, `"zstd"` and
# `method` selected from the examined file's magic bytes. So `-z` runs a program whose
# NAME is chosen by the content being inspected, which is the same hand-off as
# `git diff --ext-diff`. Stated because it is a behaviour change: on the write-flag
# table `file -z` auto-approved, and under this list it prompts.

    Sent BEFORE the permission rejection goes back on the wire, which is what
    makes it race-free: while the ``session/request_permission`` is still
    unanswered the turn is provably in flight, so the steer is queued rather than
    dropped, and kiro-cli folds it in at the next model-inference boundary — the
    one immediately after the rejected tool resolves. The model therefore learns
    why inside the SAME turn and no recovery continuation is needed.

    The notice must correct an attribution the model has already been handed:
    a rejected permission is reported to the model as a generic tool failure with
    no channel for the host to say more (ACP's permission response carries only
    ``outcome``/``optionId``). Naming kiro-cli's exact wording — measured against

    than hold both, and attributing the quote to that backend keeps the sentence
    true on another steer-capable harness whose wording has not been measured.
    ``title``/``reason`` must already be redacted by the caller.

    *cause* selects the wording. The distinction is not cosmetic: a policy block
    is a verdict the model must route around, an invalid tool name is the model's
    own malformed output and is the one case it can simply fix, and a hook fault
    judged nothing at all. Telling the model "safety policy" for the latter two
    would send it looking for an allowed alternative to an action nobody refused.

        message, and that count assumes exactly one recall-eligible row was
        appended before the turn started. ``inject`` IS recall-eligible, so a
        mid-turn note becomes the last such row and the exclusion falls on the
        note instead -- replaying the user's request and sending it twice.

        A note is owed to the next USER turn, so an AUTOMATIC successor is

        (the stage loop, which does not flush at all). Each of those is followed
        by a seam that DOES flush, so withholding delays delivery rather than
        losing it -- ``_finish_queue_cycle`` for the queued and synthesis cases,
        the stage loop's own exit for a plan, and the bulk-cleanup archive for a
        slot torn down before any of them run.

        Where it IS called above a turn's own user row, ordering is why: the
        note's context half drains inside ``_run_chat``, so flushing after the
        successor began would let the note shape a turn its visible line appears
        below. The stage loop's exit also covers the paused and cancelled paths.

        app-ownership and not ``_trust``:

        * ``_trust`` is False *by construction* wherever this predicate is

          absent — and trust is in-memory, so a gateway restart clears it on
          every app worker. A ``_trust``-based detector reads False in exactly
          the situation it exists to detect.
        * ``_app`` is set only by an app creating the slot (App Kit §5.2), is
          persisted in the session metadata, and is already the ownership axis
          every other isolation decision in these files keys on. A session a
          person created has ``_app == ""`` and is therefore never affected —
          which is what keeps interactive behaviour byte-identical.

        Both halves are persisted, and they have to be: ``_app`` surviving a
        restart while ``_human_seen`` did not is what made an attended app tab
        silently revert to the deny-fast window after every upgrade.

        *mutate* receives the live folder list and returns
        ``(changed, value)``: ``changed`` decides whether the store is written,
        ``value`` is handed back to the caller. It must be **synchronous** — it
        runs while the store lock is held, and that is what makes the whole
        find-then-modify sequence atomic against another coroutine doing the
        same thing. Do not call ``mutate_folders`` from inside *mutate*.

        Why both halves matter, from two defects this replaced:

        * **Serialized.** Every writer used to be a bare ``save_folders()``, so
          the store was race-free only because no writer yielded mid-update —
          the event loop was the lock by accident. The moment one writer
          awaited, two of them could each read a stale list and the later write
          would drop the other's folder. Holding one lock across
          modify-and-persist removes that coupling.
        * **Off the loop.** The write is a tempfile + ``os.fsync`` +
          ``os.replace``; on slow or network storage that stalls chat and
          heartbeat processing for as long as the flush takes. Only the IO
          crosses the thread boundary.

        The snapshot handed to the worker is taken here, under the lock, rather
        than letting the thread read ``self._folders``: the list is mutated on
        the loop, and serializing it from another thread could observe a
        half-applied mutation.

        If the write raises, the in-memory list is restored to its pre-callback
        state before the exception propagates, so memory never silently diverges
        from disk on a failed persist. The write is also *confirmed* before the
        lock is released (see :meth:`_write_folders_confirmed`), so a mutation
        that did not land is undone while the store is still held — no reader,

        paths ``_persist_open_slots`` uses, and for the same reason: a home
        directory on slow or network-backed storage can stall the write, and
        one stalled write on the event loop freezes every chat turn and the

        The data lock is held for the in-memory work only — the dirty check,
        the disk merge, the prune, and serialization — never across the file
        write, so a stalled disk cannot block the event loop's writers. The
        flush lock then serializes whole flushes against each other: without

        lands an OLDER serialization last, rolling the file back with the

        failure re-arms the dirty flag and is swallowed: the flush loop treats
        a raising callee as fatal, and losing every future flush over one
        failed write would be a far worse trade than retrying in 5s. The prune
        reads ``self._slots`` from a worker thread the way
        ``_flush_dirty_slots`` and ``_persist_open_slots`` already do; if the

        Entries for slots that no longer exist are dropped on the way out, so a
        deleted session cannot leave its usage behind and the file stays bounded
        by the number of open slots.

        NO-OP while ``restoring_open_slots`` is set — the same guard
        ``_persist_open_slots`` carries, for the same reason: the startup
        restore yields to the event loop between tabs, so mid-restore
        ``self._slots`` holds only the tabs restored so far, and the prune
        would read that partial set as "deleted sessions" and permanently drop
        the readings of every tab still waiting to be restored. Skipping is
