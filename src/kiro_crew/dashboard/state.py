#
# `more` did NOT fire on util-linux, which has no `+command`. It is listed anyway
# because on the BSDs `more` is not a separate program: FreeBSD's
# `usr.bin/less/Makefile` installs it as a link (`LINKS= ${BINDIR}/less
# ${BINDIR}/more`), and Apple's `less/main.c` detects the name at startup:

#
#     git branch injected # --list     -> CREATED the branch
#     git tag forged # --list          -> CREATED the tag
#     git branch injected < --list     -> CREATED the branch
#     git branch injected <<< --list   -> CREATED the branch
#
# In each case `shlex` supplied a `--list` that put the segment in list mode, so
# the operand walk read `injected` as a pattern instead of a ref to create.
#
# WHY THIS IS PER VERB AND NOT A GLOBAL REFUSAL. A phantom word can only ADD to the
# token list. For a verb decided by its FLAGS, an added word is either inert or gets
# read as a flag it does not have, so the worst case is an extra prompt: safe. Only a
# verb decided by POSITION or MODE can be flipped, because there the count and the
# order of the words carry the decision. Refusing globally cost five ordinary reads
# that no phantom word could have made unsafe (`wc -l < f`, `grep TODO < f`,
# `cat < f`, `wc -l <f`, `head -20 < log.txt`), which is a worse trade than the
# narrower rule.
#
# WHY REFUSE RATHER THAN STRIP THE REDIRECT. Stripping the operator and its target
# looks equivalent and is not: `shlex` has already discarded the quoting, so a token
# beginning with `<` is indistinguishable from a QUOTED argument that begins with
# `<`. Stripping would drop a word bash keeps, and for exactly these verbs that
# opens a hole rather than closing one: `git branch '<new'` reaches `shlex` as
# `[git, branch, <new]`, and dropping `<new` leaves a bare `git branch` that reads
# as a listing while bash creates the ref. Refusing fails closed without
# reimplementing bash's quoting rules, which this module deliberately does not do.

#     read `newbranch` as the colour and passed the segment.
#   * whether the command is in LIST mode, where an operand is a pattern to match
#     rather than a ref to create. `git branch --list newbranch` lists, it does
#     not create, so treating that operand as a creation would be a false denial.

#
# `-d` IS on the list, and the reason it is here is worth recording because an earlier
# revision of this change left it OFF on the belief that BSD/macOS `date -d` sets the
# kernel's daylight-saving value. That belief came from documentation, not from the
# implementations, and checking the implementations showed it is false on every
# platform that ships today. Read from each project's own `getopt(3)` string:
#
#   GNU coreutils      `-d STRING`  parses and PRINTS  (verified by execution, 8.22)
#   FreeBSD  bin/date  "f:I::jnRr:uv:z:"   no `d` at all -> invalid option
#   Apple    shell_cmds/date  "f:I::jnRr:uv:z:"   no `d` at all -> invalid option
#   OpenBSD  bin/date  "af:jr:uz:"         no `d` at all -> invalid option
#   NetBSD   bin/date  "ad:f:jnRr:Uuz:"    `-d` sets rflag and parsedate()s optarg,
#                                          i.e. the GNU meaning: a reference time to
#                                          PRINT. `setthetime()` is reached only from
#                                          a bare operand, never from `-d`.
#
# So `-d` either reads or errors, never writes. The historical `-d dst` that set the
# kernel daylight-saving flag is gone from every current BSD.
#
# There was also an internal tell that should have caught this without the source
# dive: `--date=` was already on the read-only long list, and `-d` is the same option
# under a shorter spelling on every implementation that has it. Admitting one and
# refusing the other could not both be right.
#
# `-s`/`--set` IS the setter GNU shares, verified accepted and failing only on
# privilege ("date: cannot set date: Operation not permitted"). `-f`, `-r`, `-I` and
# `-d` take values, which is what makes `-Iseconds`, `-r FILE` and `-d yesterday` read
# cleanly while `-s` is refused -- the dilemma that kept `-s` out of the old
# write-flag table.

# `file`'s surface, from its own `--help`. It reached an accept-list rather than a
# `-C` denylist entry because that is the shape this change keeps converging on: an
# unlisted option prompts instead of passing, so a flag missing from the help text
# costs a prompt rather than a write. `git blame --textconv` is the reason that
# distinction is not academic.
#
# `-C/--compile` is the setter: with `-m FILE` it compiles that magic file and writes
# `FILE.mgc` beside it (verified, 464 bytes). `-z/--uncompress` is ALSO excluded, on
# the omission-is-cheap principle rather than a measured escape -- libmagic can shell
# out to an external decompressor for formats it does not handle internally, and the
# flag is rare enough that a prompt costs nothing. Everything else prints.
# `f`/`--files-from` is absent, and for a different reason than `-C`: it does not
# write, it INDIRECTS. `file -f LIST` opens every path named inside LIST, and those
# paths never appear in the command, so the hook layer's path gates
# (`is_sensitive_path` / `is_sensitive_bash_command`, applied to the command text) see
# only LIST and cannot see what is actually read. A guard that inspects argv is blind
# to one more level of indirection, so the option has to go rather than the guard get
# cleverer. `sort --files0-from` was already excluded for the same shape; `hostname -F`
# is already refused as a setter.
#
# Kept: `-m/--magic-file`, `-e/--exclude`, `-F/--separator` all take a value, but the
# value IS the path or string being used, visible in argv, so the guards can act on it.
# There is no indirection to hide behind.
#
# `p`/`--preserve-date` is absent too, and it is the subtlest of the three exclusions.
# It LOOKS read-only because it RESTORES the access time rather than setting a caller
# chosen one -- which is how it was originally, and wrongly, admitted here. Restoring
# still requires a `utimes()` call on the named path, and the `ctime` that call bumps is
# NOT restorable. So the option erases the evidence that a file was read while leaving a
# permanent metadata modification behind: the wrong side of read-only in both directions.
#
# MEASURED, because `noatime` on this box hides the atime effect entirely and made the
# obvious test inconclusive. `ctime` advances on any inode metadata write and is visible
# whatever the mount options are:
#
#   file t.txt            -> ctime unchanged   (control)
#   file -b t.txt         -> ctime unchanged   (control)
#   file -p t.txt         -> ctime ADVANCED
#   file --preserve-date  -> ctime ADVANCED
#
# The same probe was then run over every other accept-list flag that opens a named file
# -- `file -m/-k/-L/-s/-r`, `sort`, `sort -u`, `sort -k1`, `date -r`, `date -f`, plus
# `cat` and `wc -l` as controls -- and all twelve are clean. `-p` is the only one.
#
# `-z`/`--uncompress` is also absent, and it belongs to a class this module already
# names elsewhere rather than to the write-flag class. From `file`'s own
# `src/compress.c`, the decompressor is SPAWNED:
#
#     status = posix_spawnp(&pid, compr[method].argv[0], &fa, NULL, ...)
#
# with `compr[]` holding `"gzip"`, `"bzip2"`, `"lzip"`, `"xz"`, `"lrzip"`, `"zstd"` and
# `method` selected from the examined file's magic bytes. So `-z` runs a program whose
# NAME is chosen by the content being inspected, which is the same hand-off as
# `git diff --ext-diff`. Stated because it is a behaviour change: on the write-flag
# table `file -z` auto-approved, and under this list it prompts.

    ONE serialiser for both delivery doors — the WebSocket arm in
    ``_broadcast_note`` and the SSE arm in ``handlers/updates.py:api_stream``.
    They are fed the same note by ``_broadcast()``, so a field added here
    reaches both; building the frame twice is how the SSE door drifts into
    dropping ``meta`` while the WS one carries it.

    ``include_metadata`` is a REQUIRED keyword and names a property of the
    TRANSPORT, not a preference: whether that door has per-client authorization
    downstream of this call.

    * The WS door does (``_send_ws_all`` -> ``_ws_client_allowed``, a
      deny-by-default event-scope gate, then ``_serialize_for_client``), so it
      passes ``True`` and lets the gate decide per socket.
    * The SSE queue does NOT. ``_broadcast()`` fans the raw note out to every
      registered queue with no per-app filtering, so ``api_stream`` must make
      the decision itself and passes ``include_metadata`` only for a
      dashboard-user token.

    That asymmetry is load-bearing. ``meta`` carries tool/LLM content
    (``tool_input``, a live ``oauth_url``, ``approval_id``), so putting it on an
    unfiltered queue exposes it to any app token granted that route regardless
    of its ``slots:*`` scope — the same class as leaking public-repo status onto
    ``/api/stream`` by enriching a payload that feeds both doors. Keep enrichment
    on the door that filters.

    ``cls``/``meta`` are conditional in BOTH directions when included: carried
    when the note has them (``meta.mid`` is the per-row delivery identity a
    client dedups on, so a frame without it cannot be recognised as a
    redelivery), and omitted entirely when it does not — an absent value must
    not arrive as a ``null`` or ``{}`` key a consumer has to special-case.

    a crash. And a ``/compact`` request answered by its compaction notice (the

    whose real reply never arrived, and that tail is a genuine interruption.

    Selects the wording injected for the model (``_MANUAL_RESUME_MSG`` vs
    ``_MANUAL_CONTINUE_MSG``), gates whether the composer offers the Resume
    control (the ``continuable && interrupted`` composition in
    ``website/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx``), and feeds the ``interrupted`` field of

    - The user pressed Stop during the turn (``user_stopped``)
    - Every refusal was already explained IN-BAND and the backend confirmed it

    ``user_stopped`` is the host's own Stop signal, read LIVE at the call: a stop
    in flight, or ``slot._stop_generation`` moved since the turn began. It is the
    only user-cancel input this gate takes; the backend's wire ``stopReason`` is
    deliberately not one. The two are not the same thing: codex-acp's command
    approval advertises ``cancel`` as its ONLY reject option (measured on
    codex-acp 1.11.0 / codex 0.153.4 -- there is no ``decline``), and codex
    answers that reject by aborting the whole turn with ``stopReason:
    "cancelled"`` before the model is called again. A gate that read that stop
    reason as a Stop press skipped this continuation on every policy block, and
    on codex this continuation is the only channel that reaches the model (the
    turn itself is gone, so no in-band notice can). A backend abort with
    refusals recorded and no Stop pressed is the refusal's own consequence, and
    the continuation is exactly what is owed.

    The parameter is keyword-only and REQUIRED so no caller can reintroduce a
    stop-reason rule by omission. Callers must read it at the gate, not from a
    snapshot taken before an await: a Stop that presses and resolves during an
    awaited Stop hook leaves ``stopping`` False again, and only the generation
    counter still says it happened.

    ``notices_sent`` is how many :func:`build_refusal_steer_notice` bodies were
    steered into the turn, and ``notices_pending`` how many of those the
    ``steering_consumed`` echo did NOT account for. The extra turn is skipped only
    when every refusal got a notice AND none is still pending -- an unconfirmed
    steer is treated as undelivered, so the fallback continuation still runs. The
    check is deliberately coarse (counts, not a per-refusal pairing): its two
    failure directions are not symmetric. Skipping wrongly leaves the model with
    kiro-cli's "User denied tool execution" and no correction, while queueing
    wrongly costs one turn the model would otherwise have been told twice --
    which is exactly what this path already cost before in-band delivery
    existed. Both keep defaults so a caller on a harness without mid-turn steer
    behaves as if nothing was steered.

    host-gate policy deny, the read-only bash safety gate, or a PreToolUse policy
    hook block — the reason reaches the dashboard pill and the SEL audit log but
    never the model: kiro-cli's own tool result for a rejected permission is the
    fixed string "User denied tool execution", which is indistinguishable from a
    human having clicked No. So the agent apologises for a cancellation that
    never happened and yields.

    This continuation is the FALLBACK path. The primary path is
    :func:`build_refusal_steer_notice`, which delivers the same reason in-band on
    a harness that supports mid-turn steer, costing no extra turn. This one runs
    when that was impossible (harness without steer) or when the steer was never
    folded in (no ``steering_consumed`` echo covered it).

    ``refusals`` is a list of ``(tool_title, reason)`` tuples recorded during the
    turn (already redacted by the caller). The returned text hands those reasons
    back to the model and frames the block as a system policy decision — NOT a
    user cancellation — so the agent can adapt (an allowed alternative, a
    different tool) or stop on its own with a reason. The caller prepends
    :data:`REFUSAL_RECOVERY_PREFIX`. Returns "" if there is nothing to recover.

    ``answered`` says the turn ALREADY streamed text the user has read, despite
    the block. The premise of the default wording — "the turn ended early, pick up
    where you left off" — is then false, and acting on it makes the model re-answer
    a question the user has already read, once per blocked call and at full turn
    cost. So the body flips to awareness-only: same block reasons, same
    remediation, but an explicit instruction not to restate what was sent.

    That flag deliberately does NOT claim the turn *finished* — no caller can tell
    a delivered answer from a one-line preamble ("Let me check the logs.") before
    the blocked call, because the two are indistinguishable prose flushed at the
    same point in the stream. So this branch conditions its instruction on whether
    the task is done rather than asserting it: continue-from-there is the default
    and stopping is the narrow case. Asserting a finished answer here would tell a
    turn that had only narrated its intent to stop with the work undone.
    The reason still has to be delivered rather than dropped, because on a backend
    without mid-turn steer this turn is the ONLY channel for it — without it the
    model's last word on the subject is kiro-cli's "User denied tool execution",
    and it will keep attributing the block to the user in later turns.

    ``turn_aborted`` says the backend ended the blocked turn as CANCELLED rather
    than letting it run on -- codex, whose only reject option aborts the turn.
    Codex then tells the model, in its own words, that the turn was interrupted
    ("aborted by user" on the tool result, a ``<turn_aborted>`` note saying the
    user interrupted on purpose). Those words are wrong here and they arrive
    right next to this continuation, so the body has to name and overrule them
    explicitly; the generic "not a user action" sentence alone loses to two
    harness-authored messages saying the opposite.

    Lives here (a leaf module that owns the prefix) rather than in context.py so
    chat_runner can import it at module top without a circular import. There is
    deliberately no retry cap: the model decides when to stop, and the user's
    Stop button remains the hard breaker.

    Sent BEFORE the permission rejection goes back on the wire, which is what
    makes it race-free: while the ``session/request_permission`` is still
    unanswered the turn is provably in flight, so the steer is queued rather than
    dropped, and kiro-cli folds it in at the next model-inference boundary — the
    one immediately after the rejected tool resolves. The model therefore learns
    why inside the SAME turn and no recovery continuation is needed.

    The notice must correct an attribution the model has already been handed:
    a rejected permission is reported to the model as a generic tool failure with
    no channel for the host to say more (ACP's permission response carries only
    ``outcome``/``optionId``). Naming kiro-cli's exact wording — measured against
    kiro-cli 2.19.1 — is what lets the model overwrite the wrong conclusion rather
    than hold both, and attributing the quote to that backend keeps the sentence
    true on another steer-capable harness whose wording has not been measured.
    ``title``/``reason`` must already be redacted by the caller.

    *cause* selects the wording. The distinction is not cosmetic: a policy block
    is a verdict the model must route around, an invalid tool name is the model's
    own malformed output and is the one case it can simply fix, a hook fault
    judged nothing at all, a batch cascade cut the group short without judging
    its members, and an expired approval prompt means nobody answered. Telling
    the model "safety policy" for any non-policy cause would send it looking for
    an allowed alternative to an action nobody refused.
    An unknown cause degrades to the policy wording rather than raising: a wrong
    noun is recoverable, and losing the notice would hand the model back
    kiro-cli's "user denied" with nothing to correct it.

        ``_app`` is the whole test, plus the ``_human_seen`` escape hatch. Why
        app-ownership and not ``_trust``:

        * ``_trust`` is False *by construction* wherever this predicate is
          consulted. The runner auto-approves and ``continue``s while trust
          holds, so a tool only reaches the interactive wait once trust is
          absent — and trust is in-memory, so a gateway restart clears it on
          every app worker. A ``_trust``-based detector reads False in exactly
          the situation it exists to detect.
        * ``_app`` is set only by an app creating the slot (App Kit §5.2), is
          persisted in the session metadata, and is already the ownership axis
          every other isolation decision in these files keys on. A session a
          person created has ``_app == ""`` and is therefore never affected —
          which is what keeps interactive behaviour byte-identical.

        Both halves are persisted, and they have to be: ``_app`` surviving a
        restart while ``_human_seen`` did not is what made an attended app tab
        silently revert to the deny-fast window after every upgrade.

        A report describes exactly ONE session. Clearing it at each teardown was
        the wrong shape — review found path after path that skipped it (the reset
        funnel, the reload and reset-conversation routes, the queued discard, a
        channel handler, the cron reaper, the task runner, a project change) — and
        a LIVENESS check ("does a session exist?") still missed the last of them,
        because a reset RECREATES a session under the same key: the slot looked
        alive while the report described the session that had gone.

        So the question asked here is identity, not liveness — is the live session
        the one this payload was taken under? A mismatch is dropped by
        construction, which closes every one of those paths at once, including any
        future one, and demotes the remaining ``clear_mcp_report()`` calls to a

        ``/api/chat/slots`` and the WebSocket snapshot go through.

        channel-born slot's turns run on the channel's own session — and is
        inlined because ``chat_utils`` imports this module. One refinement over
        that mirror: an in-flight turn's OWN key wins over the slot's routing.
        The two diverge when the routing is reassigned on a live slot — a cron
        injection binds ``linked_session_key`` to ``cron:<id>`` with no
        ``running`` gate — and the report describes the session the turn is
        actually running on, not the one a FUTURE turn would route to.
        Resolving the routing there reads a different (or absent) provider,
        mismatches, and clears a live session's report mid-turn. Same rule as
        turn cancellation: address the turn, not the routing.
