"""Adopt an EXISTING peer session into a fresh local slot (teleport-to-local).

``create_peer_slot`` MINTS a session on a crew and binds a new local slot to it.
Adopt is the other direction: the peer already holds the conversation — it is a
row the user is looking at in the merged Sessions list — and the local slot is
created to *reach* it. The bind is the same post-create stamp either way
(``executor``/``instance_id``/``remote_slot`` in ``api_chat_slot_create``), so
everything downstream of it (``relay_remote_turn``, the sidebar, the hub-driven
dedupe in ``read_peer_slots``) is untouched by this module.

Two things adopt owes that a mint does not, and they are the two halves of this
file:

**Validation.** The peer key arrives from the CALLER, so it is untrusted. It is
checked against :func:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers_instances.read_peer_slots` —
the same read the sidebar renders — which makes the check free of new policy: a
key absent from that view is forged, closed, or a slot this hub already drives,
and none of the three is adoptable. It is also where the metadata the local slot
inherits comes from (``agent``, ``model``, ``reasoning_effort``, ``title``,
``memory_mode``), so nothing the caller sends decides what the adopted session
claims to be.

**Backfill.** A minted peer session is empty, so the local transcript starts
empty and stays honest. An adopted one is not: without a backfill the user opens
a session whose history is invisible, then sends a turn the peer answers WITH
that history — a transcript that disagrees with the conversation. So the peer's
messages are copied in once, at birth.

Backfill is deliberately BEST-EFFORT (:func:`backfill_adopted_slot` never
raises). A slot that opens with a notice instead of its history is usable; a
create that 502s because the transcript read timed out leaves the user with
nothing, having already validated the target. The trust boundary is unchanged by
any of this: a remote-bound slot's local transcript already holds relayed peer
rows by ``relay_remote_turn``'s design, and every row copied here goes through
the same :func:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.remote_relay.redact_peer_text` sink those do.

#: The wire code for "that is not a session you can adopt". One code for a forged
#: key, a closed session and a slot this hub already drives, for the reason the
#: create handler's app-token refusal gives: a distinct code per reason would turn
#: this into an existence oracle for sessions on the peer.
ADOPT_TARGET_UNKNOWN = "adopt_target_unknown"

#: The wire code for "the crew did not tell us this session's memory mode". Its own
#: code rather than a reuse of the one above: unlike a forged key, this names a
#: readable session the hub is DECLINING to open, so the client can say why and a
#: retry against an upgraded peer can succeed. No oracle concern -- it reveals only
#: that a row lacked a field the peer already sends for its own sessions.
ADOPT_PEER_MODE_UNKNOWN = "adopt_peer_mode_unknown"

#: Byte ceiling on the peer's transcript reply, bounding what is BUFFERED before
#: anything is decoded — the discipline every peer read on this boundary follows.
#: Generous rather than tight because the decision (plan B4) is FULL history: a
#: multi-MB session is the case this is for, not the case it refuses. Meta carries
#: the tool inputs and outputs, which is most of the volume.
PEER_TRANSCRIPT_REPLY_MAX_BYTES = 16 * 1024 * 1024

#: Row ceiling after decoding, bounding what is then PROCESSED (each row runs the
#: redaction chain). Under ``state._MAX_SLOT_MESSAGES`` (10000) on purpose: rows
#: past the local window cap would be trimmed off the head by ``slot.append``
#: anyway, so copying them buys nothing and costs a redaction pass each. The TAIL
#: is kept when this binds — the recent turns are the ones the next turn is about.
PEER_TRANSCRIPT_MAX_ROWS = 4000

#: The tail size asked for when the full read came back oversized. The peer clamps
#: ``limit`` to 500 (``api_chat_slot_detail``), so this is the largest honest ask.
PEER_TRANSCRIPT_FALLBACK_LIMIT = 500

#: Roles copied into the local transcript verbatim.
#:
#: ``thinking`` is included because the peer keeps its own copy of those rows and
#: ``_apply_row`` relays them for a live turn — excluding them here would make an
#: adopted transcript diverge from the same session's relayed continuation.
_BACKFILL_ROLES = frozenset(
    {"user", "assistant", "thinking", "tool_call", "tool_result", "system", "error"}
)

#: Roles DROPPED, each for its own reason:
#:
#: ``chunk``/``done`` are wire-only and the peer's own projection already removed
#: them (``_collapse_wire_rows``); if a peer on another build sends them anyway
#: they are stream bookkeeping, not transcript.
#:
#: ``permission`` is the one that is a judgement rather than a formality. It
#: renders an approval bar, and an adopted one has no local future to resolve — the
#: buttons would answer ``404 no pending approval`` on a card the user cannot
#: dismiss. The record of the approval is not lost from the conversation: the
#: ``tool_call``/``tool_result`` pair it gated is copied. This is the same
#: pending-approval gap ``relay_remote_turn`` already has (plan E1), not a new one.
_BACKFILL_SKIP_ROLES = frozenset({"chunk", "done", "permission"})

#: The role a still-streaming segment arrives as. The peer's projection folds a
#: run of ``chunk`` rows into one row under this name, and it appears ONLY while a
#: turn is in flight over there — finalizing the segment drops those rows and
#: appends the finished ``assistant`` message instead (``_finalize_streamed_segment``).
#:
#: It is DROPPED rather than mapped to ``assistant``. Mapping it kept the visible
#: text of an in-flight turn, which reads like the better trade until you follow
#: what happens next: this hub never mirrors a turn it did not start, so the
#: suffix never arrives, and the frozen snapshot is then re-serialized into the
#: local transcript file where nothing distinguishes it from a reply that really
#: ended there. The user is left with a truncated answer presented as a complete
#: one, permanently, with no way to tell. Dropping it loses the same text but says
#: so in the transcript (``_BACKFILL_IN_FLIGHT_NOTICE``, carried in the same leading
#: notice row as the truncation one), which is the difference between an absence and
#: a falsehood.
#:
#: Refusing the adopt outright was the other option and is worse: adopting a
#: session the peer is actively answering in is a normal, supported case, so a
#: refusal would break the feature to avoid the bug.
_STREAMING_ROLE = "streaming"


#: The three notices a backfill can leave in the transcript. Text, not codes:
#: nothing branches on them, the user reads them where the missing history would
#: have been. Named so the tests pin the CONDITION rather than the wording.
#:
#: Each NAMES the machine rather than saying "the crew". Two reasons, both from a
#: blind read of the shipped strings: "crew" already names the autonomous-agent
#: feature elsewhere in the product, so it reads as the wrong noun here; and a
#: notice that does not say WHICH machine leaves the user with no way to act on it
#: when several are connected. The name is the same one the sidebar badge shows.

    Read off the PEER's row rather than the request body: the peer already chose

    that matters — already has a ``memory_mode``. That mode is the user's privacy
    boundary, so an adopted session must carry the peer's, not this machine's
    default; defaulting it would let a session the user opened as ``incognito``
    over there start writing memory the moment it was opened here.

    ``model`` gets the same treatment as ``agent``, and for a reason that is only
    partly cosmetic. Execution is never in doubt — the relayed turn body carries
    no model at all, so the peer's own slot decides what answers — but the LOCAL
    slot's ``model`` is what the header renders, what the context window is

    peer session that is actually pinned, the picker is seeded from the peer's
    roster with no current value, so the user's first pick goes through
    ``forward_peer_selection`` and OVERWRITES a live conversation's real pin.

    There is deliberately no allowlist: a model id is an opaque string this
    machine's roster has no standing to judge, and refusing one the local gateway
    does not recognise would reject exactly the cross-version peer whose pin
    matters most. ``served_model`` is NOT a fallback either — it is the value the
    live session resolved to for display, and persisting it here would fabricate a
    user pin out of a runtime detail.

    Every value is bounded and pushed through the peer-text sink, because these
    land on a local slot (and its sidebar row) as strings the peer authored. An
    unrecognised ``memory_mode`` is dropped rather than coerced — the create
    handler validates the mode it is given, and inventing one here would smuggle
