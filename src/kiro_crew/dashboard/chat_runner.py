    production code). One histogram powers both turn latency and fault rate.

    ``duration_ms`` is the provider-reported duration and ``elapsed_ms`` the
    locally measured wall clock; the first non-zero wins. Both are needed
    because the acp provider ALWAYS reports ``TurnUsage.duration_ms == 0``
    (nothing in the codebase assigns it — only claude_code fills it in), so a
    provider-only value silently skipped the emit for effectively all traffic
    and left turn latency / fault rate / throughput reading a flat 0.

    A still-zero duration skips the emit deliberately: an absent sample reads
    as "no data" on the Telemetry page, whereas a recorded 0 would render as a
    plausible-looking 0ms p50 — the very symptom this guard's misuse caused.

    Caveat on what the wall clock measures: ``elapsed_ms`` runs from the start
    of the turn, so a turn parked on an interactive tool-approval prompt counts
    the operator's thinking time as turn duration. There is no finer-grained
    source on the acp path (the provider reports nothing at all), so this is

    Membership is an ownership FACT, not a decision about what the user sees: it
    only tells the caller that a card surface drives this server's consent flow,
    so a request for it can be tagged ``card_owned`` and the render layer given
    something to act on. Nothing here suppresses anything.

    Two conditions, both required, each consumed from the facility that already
    decides it rather than re-derived here:

    * :func:`kirocrew_managed_names` -- our own MCP store wrote the entry. This is
      the single ownership discriminator, shared with the agent-spec emit path and
      the config-sync gate, so ownership means one thing everywhere.
    * :func:`get_visible_providers` -- the name is a Connections provider with a
      rendered card. Connect keys the store by provider slug and the card reads it
      back by slug, so the slug is the join between the two.

    Ownership ALONE is not enough. The dashboard's add-custom-server API writes to
    the same store, so a hand-added remote is every bit as "ours" while having no
    card anywhere. A provider whose launch gate is closed has no card either.
    Requiring a card keeps the annotation on servers that genuinely have a second
    surface, so the render layer never has to second-guess it.

    Registry slugs are slash-free, so ``mcp_server_alias`` is the identity on this
    set and kiro-cli's ``serverName`` is the slug verbatim -- no alias widening is
    needed. What remains open is an exact-slug collision: a server hand-added
    under a real slug is annotated, though it still renders on that provider's
    card, so a surface survives.

    Does blocking file I/O (store read + registry read) -- callers on the event
    loop must hand it to a worker thread.

    FAILS OPEN to the empty set on any error: nothing is annotated and every
    surface renders every banner, which is exactly today's behavior.

#                          URLs prints a credential into context the same way
#                          cookie-list does.
#   request / request-headers / request-body, response-headers / response-body
#                        — print a request's headers verbatim, i.e. its
#                          Authorization and Cookie values.
#   close / tab-close / close-all / kill-all
#                        — `attach` points the CLI at the operator's OWN browser,
#                          holding their live logins and their open tabs, so these
#                          take that window (or every session at once) down and
#                          unsaved work with it. Nothing recovers it. The agent
#                          prompt already says never to close an attached browser,
#                          but prose the model is asked to honor is advice, not a
#                          control, and the gate cannot see whether a session is
#                          attached or CLI-owned — so it fails closed. `detach`
#                          stays approved: it releases the session and leaves the
#                          window alone, which is what cleanup actually needs.
#   config-print         — prints the session's launch configuration, and the
#                          documented way to constrain this browser is a proxy
#                          set through `launchOptions.proxy.server`, whose value
#                          carries the proxy credential. So the verb that reads
#                          "harmless settings dump" prints a secret on exactly
#                          the setup this design recommends.
#   state-save           — serialises the WHOLE storage state, cookies included,
#                          to a file the agent can then read with its own file
#                          tools. Bare-form no longer helps: the file is the
#                          credential.
#   delete-data          — with `attach`, the CLI operates the operator's REAL
#                          logged-in browser. `delete-data` destroys session
#                          state (cookies, storage, cache) nothing recovers —
#                          equivalent to the user clicking "Clear all site data"
#                          on every origin the browser knows.
#   cookie-set / cookie-delete / cookie-clear,
#   localstorage-set / localstorage-delete / localstorage-clear,
#   sessionstorage-set / sessionstorage-delete / sessionstorage-clear
#                        — `attach` means the operator's REAL browser. The -set
#                          verbs are session fixation (inject a controlled
#                          credential the attacker can reuse); the -delete and
#                          -clear verbs destroy operator login state nothing
#                          recovers. Both directions reach outside "inside the
#                          page" once the page IS the operator's live session.
#   route / unroute / network-state-set
#                        — a route intercepts requests and returns forged
#                          responses. The agent reads the page (via `snapshot`),
#                          so a route lets an injected agent control what the
#                          NEXT read returns — fabricating confirmation of an
#                          action that never happened or hiding an error the
#                          operator should see. `unroute` removes a route the
#                          operator set intentionally. `network-state-set`
#                          toggles offline mode, severing the page from its
#                          server — a denial-of-service on the operator's
#                          browsing.
# A prompt-injected agent must not be able to convert "browsing is allowed"
# into arbitrary code execution, arbitrary local reads, or arbitrary writes.
# Auto-approval must never become a local-machine primitive: the effect of a
# read is the VALUE it prints into the agent's context, and that value
# determines whether the verb is safe — not whether the verb's blast radius
# stays "inside the page".


# Flags that carry no local-filesystem path and no code. An ALLOWLIST for the
# same fail-closed reason as the verb list. It is load-bearing rather than
# cosmetic: the CLI takes an output path as `--filename=<name>`, so a path can
# arrive as a FLAG and not only as a positional argument. Skipping unrecognized
# flags on the way to the verb would therefore auto-approve an arbitrary local
# WRITE. Anything not listed here falls through to interactive approval --
# notably:
#   --filename  MEASURED: the value is resolved against the CLI invocation's
#               CWD, *not* against PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_OUTPUT_DIR (that variable only
#               governs auto-generated names). So even a bare
#               `--filename=README.md` overwrites a file in the user's repo, and
#               there is no "safe" spelling of it to allow. The un-named form
#               (`playwright-cli screenshot`) IS auto-approved and writes into
#               the service's own directory, printing the path -- so the capture

    Refused, so that navigation there costs one interactive approval:

    * **Every local control plane.** Kiro Crew's own dashboard is served over

      it -- so an auto-approved ``goto`` plus auto-approved clicks would let the
      agent widen its own ceiling with no human in the loop. The rule is the
      whole loopback range and the loopback names rather than one port number:
      the dashboard's port is only known at runtime (a pod gets its own), and
      "never auto-drive a local admin UI" covers the dashboard, pods, and
      anything else the operator happens to run on the host under one rule.
      ``0.0.0.0`` / ``::`` are refused with it, because a listener bound to the
      unspecified address is reachable that way too.
    * **Link-local**, where cloud instance metadata and its credentials live: a
      ``goto`` followed by an auto-approved ``snapshot`` would print an instance
      role's credentials into the agent's context.
    * **Private** (RFC 1918: 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16), **CGNAT/shared**
      (100.64/10), and **all other non-globally-routable addresses** including
      multicast, reserved/future-use, documentation, and benchmarking ranges.
      A ``goto http://10.0.0.5/admin`` followed by an auto-approved ``snapshot``
      prints internal infrastructure responses into the agent's context -- the
      same SSRF vector as link-local, aimed at internal services rather than
      the metadata endpoint.

    Ranges are tested by ``ipaddress``' own ``is_global`` property (True only
    for globally-routable addresses), applied to both the address itself and
    any embedded IPv4 (``ipv4_mapped``, ``sixtofour``). ``is_global`` subsumes
    loopback, link-local, unspecified, private, CGNAT/shared, multicast,
    reserved, documentation, and benchmarking ranges in one predicate, without
    hand-rolled CIDRs.

    DNS names are NOT resolved. Resolving inside the approval predicate is a
    blocking network call on the hot path AND a DNS-rebinding TOCTOU: a name can
    answer a public address at approval time then resolve to a private one when
    the browser re-resolves milliseconds later. The residual risk (a public name
    pointing at a private address) is accepted; browser-side network policy is
    the correct mitigation layer for that class.

    Ordinary public http(s) browsing is unaffected and stays auto-approved.

    Load-bearing for approval, not cosmetic: every construct here is performed by

    it. They inspect the tokens they are handed; the shell decides what those
    tokens become.

    * **Redirection.** An otherwise-approved ``playwright-cli snapshot`` with
      ``> somefile`` appended CREATES OR TRUNCATES that file. The segment splitter
      does not cut on ``>``, so ``>`` and the path arrive as ordinary positionals
      and the whole thing reads as "snapshot with two extra arguments".
    * **Expansion.** ``open "${PATH:+file:///etc/passwd}"`` is not URI-shaped when
      the guard sees it, so it passes as ordinary page input — and the shell then
      expands it into a ``file://`` URL, making the next ``snapshot`` an arbitrary
      local file read. ``$VAR`` and backticks are the same mechanism, and so is
      brace expansion: ``{file:///etc/passwd,}`` expands to that URL with no
      variable and no substitution involved. A leading ``~`` expands to a home
      directory the same way.

    Globbing (``*``, ``?``, ``[]``) is deliberately NOT treated as a hazard, and
    the asymmetry is the point: brace and tilde expansion ALWAYS rewrite the

    ``?`` would deny every URL carrying a query string, which is most of them.
    A glob that does match names a local file, and no auto-approved verb takes a
    local path as a positional.

    One quote-aware walker serves all of it, because a second shell parser is how
    a bypass gets introduced. Quote rules are the shell's own: single quotes make

    The persisted ``ChannelLink`` records a conversation, not a principal, which is
    what made a revoked recipient unanswerable for the transports whose conversation
    id is not their user id. The session KEY carries it: the canonical grammar is
    ``{surface}:{agent}:{chat_type}:{scope…}`` and for a 1:1 DM the scope is exactly
    the peer's platform id. Parsing goes through ``messaging.link.parse_session_key``
    because that module is the ONE canonical address parser (RFC §9 rule 4); a second
    decomposition here would drift from the grammar the keys are built with.

    Derived from the KEY ALONE, deliberately. Two other records name a peer and
    neither is safe here, because a principal is only usable if it describes the
    conversation the link points at:

    * the session's stored channel value (``{namespace}:{user_id}``) is written ONCE,
      when the session is created, while the origin/mirror link is rewritten on
      later turns. Under a ``unified`` bucket -- which collapses several peers' 1:1
      DMs into one session on purpose -- the two therefore drift: the attribution can
      name the peer who created the session while the link points at a different
      peer's conversation. Authorizing against it would check the wrong person and
      pass, which is worse than declining to name one.
    * a **forum or group** scope is ``(chat_id, thread_id)``, so its audience is a
      room and no single principal owns it. Returning ``scope[0]`` would hand a
      supergroup id to a check that tests USER rosters.

    Empty therefore means "the key does not name one principal", never "no principal
    is authorized". A transport whose other rosters can still judge the route (a
    Discord thread against its thread allow-list) uses them; one with nothing left to
    consult refuses, because this feeds a network egress boundary.

    """Open the retention window on a drained completion once its turn has RUN.

    The gateway records the owed agent ids on the slot when it has to QUEUE a
    sub-agent completion (``KiroCrewGateway._defer_queued_delivery``), keyed on the
    announce content, which is what keeps each ``result.txt`` alive for as long as
    the row waits. This is the other half — but it deliberately does not fire at
    dispatch.

    A ``delivered`` tombstone is durable and excludes the folder from restart
    orphan reconciliation, while a dispatched turn is not yet durable: the
    injected row is still being persisted and the model has not necessarily
    consumed the prompt. Writing the tombstone at dispatch would mean a crash in
    that window loses the completion for good (no queue row left, no folder to
    recover, and the result pruned one TTL later). Waiting for the task to finish
    makes the failure mode fail-safe instead: nothing is written, so the next
    start's reconciliation still sees the folder and re-delivers it.

    Nothing is settled until the model has CONSUMED the prompt, and that is the
    only condition. ``_run_chat`` handles a signed-out CLI, a dead provider,
    exhausted prompt-busy retries, a transient backend error and a stall by
    rendering a card and RETURNING NORMALLY, several of them after re-queueing the
    prompt itself for a later retry — so the task's outcome says nothing either way.
    *consumed* is the evidence that does: ``_run_chat`` sets it on the provider's
    turn-complete event for a real end-of-turn, or earlier on the first streamed
    token or fired tool call. Those triggers are exactly the states in which the
    announce will NOT be replayed. An EMPTY response splits: the FIRST one
    re-queues this same announce verbatim and RETRACTS the report, so the clock
    waits for the replay that lands; the second re-queues a continuation instead
    and stays consumed.

    Consumption is one-way, so a turn cancelled or failed after it still settles:
    the result is in the model's context either way, and withholding the tombstone
    would have the next start re-announce a completion the parent already read.

    *consumed* is a cell owned by THIS armed turn, never slot-wide state: a turn's
    tail-drain starts its successor before the predecessor's callback runs, so a
    shared field would be reset by the successor and leave the earlier — already
    consumed — completion unsettled and re-injected after a restart.

    An unconsumed turn settles nothing, which is the fail-safe side: the folder
    survives for the replay to read and the next start's reconciliation recovers
    it, where a premature tombstone would have the reaper delete a result the
    parent never saw.

    Authorization is decided when a prompt is ADMITTED (`authorize_target` for

    containment those decisions rest on can change in between: a target
    authorized while unlinked can be given a channel or mirror link before its
    queue drains, and the queued prompt would then execute and republish to an
    audience its admission never contemplated.

    Producers of plain (user-speech) entries stamp the containment snapshot at
    enqueue (`session_control.containment_meta`); this sweep recomputes the same
    constraints and drops any entry for which a constraint holds NOW that did
    not hold at admission — including a WORKSPACE change, which swaps the
    memory/lessons/project context under a waiting prompt. An unmarked plain
    entry fails closed against the boolean constraint set, so an untagged
    producer can never ride a queued prompt past a boundary the tagged paths
    respect.

    Entries carrying `_directive_user_origin` (authenticated-human provenance)
    are exempt from the AUDIENCE constraints only (linked/mirrored): the author
    is the person who widened their own session's audience, and composer input
    into a linked session is designed behaviour. All other constraints still
    apply to them (see `session_control.newly_held_constraints`).

    Structural exemption is narrow: cron notifications and sub-agent
    completions only (`CRON_NOTIFICATION_KIND` / `SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_KIND`) —
    runner machinery minted fresh by trusted internal producers, which
    channel-born sessions receive by design. Synthetic-recovery entries are
    NOT exempt: a recovery replays externally admitted content verbatim, so it
    is re-validated like any plain entry against the admission stamp its
    requeue recorded (`_queue_recovery`), failing closed when unmarked.

    Runs at the top of the drain with no suspension point between the snapshot
    and the dequeue (everything below is synchronous on the event loop), so the
    decision cannot go stale before the surviving entry becomes a turn. A drop
    is never silent: the queue card is retracted, a visible notice naming the
    changed constraint lands in the transcript, and the drop is written to the
