"""Session control: letting one chat session observe and interrupt another.

Four operations — create a session, stop its turn, close (archive) it, and read
its transcript — plus the authorization that decides whether a caller may address
a target at all. The operations are deliberately thin: they reuse the same
creation, stop, close and history paths the dashboard itself uses, so a controlled
session behaves exactly like one a human is typing into.

**One verb here writes into another session's conversation: ``session_send``.**
Reading returns a transcript tail; stopping cancels an in-flight turn the way the
Stop button does; closing archives the session the way the tab ✕ does (the
conversation is saved to history and can be reopened — closing is not deletion);
creating opens an empty session in the user's sidebar; sending
delivers a message the target runs as its next turn, redacted through
``sanitize_outbound`` and prefixed with a ``[sent by session … via session_send]``
envelope so it can never render as something the person typed. An IDLE target runs
it under the authorization that admitted it; a BUSY target queues it, and the
generic drain re-asserts the target-side containment before the entry becomes a
turn: producers stamp the constraints that held at admission
(:func:`containment_meta`), and ``chat_runner``'s drain drops — with a visible
notice and an SEL record — any entry for which a constraint holds at delivery
that did not hold at admission. A human-typed queued message shares the same
window and the same re-check.

Authorization is deny-by-default and checked in one place
(:func:`authorize_target`) for the three operations that take a target — stop,
close and read — so a guard cannot be present on one verb and missing on another.
``session_create`` has no target; it checks the caller's own eligibility with the
same refusals.

    An app-scoped SESSION is refused by the ``_app`` check that sits beside every
    call site of this one, but a cron tab does not carry that tag:
    ``inject_cron_result_to_dashboard`` mints it without ``app=``, so an app's own
    scheduled job reaches this surface with ``_app == ""`` and would pass. Left
    unchecked, an app could create a persistent, sidebar-visible session that is
    NOT app-scoped -- precisely the confinement escape the ``_app`` refusal exists
    to prevent, reached through the app's scheduled job instead of its session.

    App ownership therefore has to be read from the JOB, and it has TWO spellings
    there because two writers record it differently: the app cron SDK tags
    ``created_by = "app:{app_name}"``, while ``mcp_cron``'s own ``cron_add``
    records the calling session in ``session_key`` and never writes ``created_by``
    at all -- so an app-scoped session's job carries its authority only in the
    second. Both are checked, and the second delegates to ``_app`` on the owning
    slot rather than re-deriving app-ness, so there is one definition of "is this
    an app" and not a third. **A new field on the job that can name a principal is
    a hole here until it is added to this function.**

    Fail-CLOSED when ``session_key`` names a closed session: its
    ``_app`` cannot be read, and "could not verify the owner is not an app" must
    not read as "has no owner". ``mcp_cron``'s ``cron_add`` records an app's
    authority ONLY in ``session_key`` -- so once that slot is gone, allowing the
    job would let an app escape confinement through a cron it authored and then
    abandoned by closing its session. The cost is a genuinely user-created
    dispatching cron whose authoring tab has closed is refused too; that caller
    can reopen a tab, whereas an app session minted outside its confinement cannot
    be undone. This is the same fail-closed direction the missing-job case below
    takes, and what still bounds the app case beyond it is that a LIVE app session
    has its jobs refused directly by the ``_app`` read.

    Fail-CLOSED on a job that cannot be found, or a registry that cannot answer:
    "could not verify the owner" must not read as "has no owner", the same
    direction ``agent_unverifiable`` takes on its own unreadable input. Nothing
    legitimate is refused by it, because a cron whose job is gone is not running.

    Returns rather than raises so each call site keeps its own idiom -- the create
    path raises ``SessionControlError`` directly, while ``authorize_target`` must
    go through its ``deny`` closure to get the audit record and the 403.

    # USER-labelled child would hand a cron the exposure its own slot is denied,

        #   of the grant. The session-store half needs no write here: the child has
        #   no ACP session yet (`set_approval_policy` would silently no-op on a
        #   missing session), and `chat_runner` already assigns the persistable
        #   policy from `_trust` on every session create/resume, so the subagent
        #   spawn gate sees it from the child's first turn.
        # * `_trust_reads` -- the same posture, narrowed to read-only bash. It has
        #   to carry too, or the setting a CAUTIOUS operator picks is the one whose
        #   own workers still stall. Bounded by construction: what it admits has no
        #   side effects, which is what separates it from the command grants below.
        #
        # * `_trusted_patterns` -- NOT inherited. These are per-command grants
        #   ("`npm test` is fine"), not a posture, and the distinction decides it:
        #   a pattern is judged against the session the operator was LOOKING at,
        #   while a dispatched worker runs model-authored work they have not seen,
        #   so the same glob can admit a command the grant was never asked about.
        #   Inheriting them also buys nothing where it would be safe -- with
        #   `_trust` set the child already auto-approves via `_slot_is_trusted`, so
        #   the pattern list is dead weight; it changes the outcome ONLY when the
        #   operator withheld session trust and granted single commands instead,
        #   which is exactly the case that must keep asking. So the child starts
        #   with `_ChatSlot.__init__`'s empty set and earns its own grants.
        # * `_trust_scope` -- NOT inherited. It names a TTL-bounded, SEL-audited
        #   `SafetyOverride` grant that is re-checked on every approval; forking
        #   the key would hand a second session a credential whose revocation
