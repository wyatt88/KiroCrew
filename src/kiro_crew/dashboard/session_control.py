"""Session control: letting one chat session observe and interrupt another.

Three operations — create a session, stop its turn, read its transcript — plus the
authorization that decides whether a caller may address a target at all. The
operations are deliberately thin: they reuse the same creation, stop and history
paths the dashboard itself uses, so a controlled session behaves exactly like one
a human is typing into.

**One verb here writes into another session's conversation: ``session_send``.**
Reading returns a transcript tail; stopping cancels an in-flight turn the way the
Stop button does; creating opens an empty session in the user's sidebar; sending
delivers a message the target runs as its next turn, redacted through
``sanitize_outbound`` and prefixed with a ``[sent by session … via session_send]``
envelope so it can never render as something the person typed. An IDLE target runs
it under the authorization that admitted it; a BUSY target queues it, and the
generic drain re-asserts the target-side containment before the entry becomes a
turn (issue #5911): producers stamp the constraints that held at admission
(:func:`containment_meta`), and ``chat_runner``'s drain drops — with a visible
notice and an SEL record — any entry for which a constraint holds at delivery
that did not hold at admission. A human-typed queued message shares the same
window and the same re-check.

Authorization is deny-by-default and checked in one place
(:func:`authorize_target`) for the two operations that take a target, so a guard
cannot be present on one verb and missing on another. ``session_create`` has no
target; it checks the caller's own eligibility with the same refusals.
