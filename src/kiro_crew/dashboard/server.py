    :func:`_make_host_validation_middleware`. In particular this is the SINGLE
    read point for ``token_auth.CSRF_EXEMPT_EXACT_METHODS``, so an exemption can
    never be granted on one server and withheld on the other.

    Blocks state-mutating requests that a cross-origin page issued. Loopback
    local processes (mcp-core, cron, doctor) send no Origin header and are
    trusted by ``check_origin``; a browser always sends Origin, so a cross-site
    page is rejected here even before token auth runs.

    Webhook exemption: a self-authenticating external webhook is a
    server-to-server caller that sends neither ``Origin`` nor ``Referer``, which
    ``check_origin`` can only accept from a loopback peer — so without the
    exemption the route is unreachable in the topology that exposes the gateway
    directly, with no configuration that fixes it. Those handlers ignore cookies
    and authenticate a bearer credential a browser cannot forge, which is the
    entire threat CSRF addresses; ``token_auth.CSRF_EXEMPT_EXACT_METHODS`` holds
    the full decision, and any addition to it is a security review. The exempted
    request is still audited — ``sel_audit_middleware`` logs every mutating
    ``/api/`` call in both chains — so the carve-out writes no SEL event of its
    own, matching ``PROBE_PATHS`` on the Host barrier.

    ``caller`` labels the SEL audit line (``dashboard_user`` for the full
    dashboard, ``mcp_tool`` for the headless API server).

    ``parse_dashboard_url`` substitute the default port — right for the server

    a gateway that may be bound elsewhere.

    Deliberately a DISTINCT variable from ``KIROCREW_PORT``: that one means

    ``KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT`` carries ephemeral truth only: consumed by
    ``port_resolution.resolve_client_port`` one step below the operator override,

    sender, never an address chosen here. Each channel is independent: one that

    **Exactly one candidate across EVERY channel, or nothing.** This notice carries the

    has an owner id and is preferred above; nothing else does. An allow-list is a list of
    people permitted to TALK to the agent, not a claim that any of them is the operator.

    So the only sound inference is a counting one, and it has to be counted across the
    whole install rather than per channel. Two channels each holding a DIFFERENT single
    identity is two people, and delivering to both hands one of them the other's security
    state — a per-channel "exactly one target" rule misses that entirely. With exactly one
    reachable person in the whole configuration, that person is the operator; with two or
    more, refuse everybody. Same premise as `/sessions`' owner-only rule.

    Counted over ALL configured targets, not just the reachable ones: a three-person
    allow-list where only one route happens to have been learned is still a guess.

    The false negative is deliberate and is the safe direction: the same human configured
    on two channels reads as two candidates and gets no channel notice. The dashboard feed

    misdelivery would cost the operator's security state. Positively binding a channel

    """Register the tunnel teardown hook on ``app``'s shutdown path.

    Without this the tunnel is started (``tunnel/setup.py`` → ``TunnelManager.start()``)
    and then NEVER stopped: ``TunnelManager.stop()`` had no production caller, so
    whatever the active ``TunnelProvider`` brought up outlived the gateway — even
    on a clean Ctrl+C. A companion provider that supervises a child process
    leaked it (reparented to PID 1) and the next gateway start collided on the
    same tunnel name. The manager is edition-neutral, so stopping it here tears
    down EVERY provider (the public Default's ``stop()`` is a no-op).

    Registered like the other long-lived subsystems (``_watchdog_shutdown``,
    ``_register_instances_hooks``): the hook is appended BEFORE ``runner.setup()``
    freezes the app's signal lists, and reads ``state.tunnel_manager`` lazily —
    the manager is only assigned later, after ``setup_tunnel`` runs, and this
    hook fires at shutdown, long after that assignment. That lazy read is also
    what lets the REGISTRATION sit first in ``start_dashboard``: ``on_cleanup``
    handlers are dispatched in registration order under a hard shutdown
    deadline, so a tunnel hook queued behind the other subsystems can be starved
    (instances cleanup waiting on SSH children that ignore SIGTERM eats the
    deadline, the gateway force-exits, and the tunnel is never stopped).

    Two teardown paths, because a live tunnel does not imply a manager:
    ``setup_tunnel`` builds a ``TunnelManager`` and the hook stops that, but the
    on-demand link path (``slack.use_tunnel_url`` →
    ``current_context().tunnel.ensure_available()`` in ``slack/allowlist.py``)
    provisions and starts a tunnel straight on the provider and never constructs
    a manager. With ``state.tunnel_manager`` still None, bailing out left exactly
    the orphan this hook exists to prevent, so the no-manager path stops
    ``current_context().tunnel`` directly. Only one path runs per shutdown — the
    manager delegates to the same provider — so nothing is stopped twice.

    Failure containment: ``on_cleanup`` handlers run in sequence and a raise
    aborts the remaining ones, so a tunnel teardown must never propagate. BOTH
    paths go through ``_stop_bounded``: the stop is bounded by
    ``_TUNNEL_STOP_TIMEOUT_SECS`` and every exception is logged and swallowed, so
    neither a hanging nor a raising provider — nor a fail-closed
    ``current_context()`` — can block or crash the rest of gateway shutdown.
    ``TunnelManager.stop()`` is itself idempotent (it re-delegates and, on
    failure, simply declines to pin STOPPED) and a provider ``stop()`` is
    expected to be too, so a shutdown path that runs twice is harmless on either
    path.
