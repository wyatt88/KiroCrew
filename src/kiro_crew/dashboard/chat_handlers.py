    Three values, because the panel has three honest things to say and a bool
    could only carry two: ``ready`` (offer the button), ``too_few_turns`` (say so
    plainly and offer nothing -- a click could only fail), and ``unavailable``
    (the feature is off, a pass is already running, or the session is incognito
    and must never leave a durable artifact). Collapsing the last two into
    "not enough messages" would print a reason that is simply untrue for an
    incognito session.

    The turn count is an ESTIMATE from the slot's IN-MEMORY messages, not a
    transcript read: this runs on every panel mount and tab switch, and reading a
    thousand-message session from disk to answer a yes/no question is waste. A
    restored slot keeps only a window of its transcript, and the window is NOT a
    safe proxy for the whole session -- a tail made mostly of assistant replies
    and injected automation messages can hold fewer than the minimum genuine user
    turns while the file holds dozens. So `too_few_turns` is only claimed when the
    window IS the whole session (`_disk_older_count == 0`); a truncated window
    reports `ready` and lets the POST's disk-backed count decide.

    The authoritative gate lives in the generator and reads disk; if this estimate
    is wrong the POST refuses and says why, so the cost is a refused click, never
    a wasted call.

    A turn in flight is deliberately NOT one of these values, even though the
    generator refuses one. This field is only refreshed when a summary is written,
    so a state that begins and ends mid-turn would arrive stale and stay stale: a
    turn that ends without producing a summary (stopped, or gated by cadence)
    pushes no event, and the panel would sit on a dead verdict until it remounted.
    The panel already holds a live per-slot turn signal, so it owns that
    presentation and this field stays limited to what only the server knows.

    A persisted row can differ from its window copy by exactly the redaction

    verbatim (``chat_persistence.py:708-709``), so the window holds the redacted
    text; a save redacts every non-user role on the way out
    (``chat_persistence.py:1282-1284``) while the window keeps it verbatim
    (``state.py:2107``), so in a session that was never restored the DISK holds the
    redacted text instead. Redacting one side only cannot converge on that second
    pair — redacting an already-redacted body just reproduces it — so the row reads
    as un-flushed and the persisted suffix is appended twice.

    Applying the transform is also what separates a persisted row from a foreign
    row that merely shares a ``ts``: on a coarse clock two writers flooring off the
    same previous row both emit ``previous + 1µs`` (``history.py:1179-1219``), so
    matching on ``ts`` alone treats an unrelated row as the window's own and drops
    an un-flushed message from a response the client uses as a replacement.

    Two bodies can redact to the same text while being different messages, so the
    redaction-equivalent branch ALSO requires the stamps to match. That costs the
    legitimate case nothing: this branch only ever fires for a row and its own
    persisted copy, which differ by the transform precisely because one side was
    redacted, and both the save and the load copy ``ts`` verbatim
    (``chat_persistence.py:1288`` and ``:714``). A foreign row whose credential
    merely redacts to the same text carries its own writer's stamp, so it no longer
    consumes the window row.

    The requirement is on this branch ALONE, which is why it does not reintroduce
    the duplication above. A durable injection is byte-identical to its window row,
    so it returns at the plain-equality check and never reaches here — and that pair
    genuinely does carry different stamps, because the two writers mint

    """Append window messages that are not yet on disk to a chained disk read.

    ``all_msgs`` is a disk read, so it omits transient roles while the window
    retains them, and it spans any older sessions a chained read walks. Sizing the
    tail by subtracting the two lengths therefore mixes units AND measures the
    whole file: it both re-appends rows the disk read already returned and lets a
    row from another writer consume a turn that is still owed.

    Takes the window itself rather than a caller-supplied count, so a caller cannot
    pass a length captured before an ``await``; the window can grow while a threaded
    disk read is in flight. ``snapshot`` is the one safe way to supply it: a
    ``(disk_older_count, window)`` PAIR from ``_snapshot_slot_window`` captured on
    the event loop AFTER the disk read, which is consistent by construction and
    cannot observe a mid-finalization window. Passing no snapshot falls back to
    capturing inside this thread, which is weaker — see that helper.

    Prefer message identity. A save copies each window row's ``meta.mid`` to disk,
    so a window row whose id appears in the disk read is persisted. A durable
    injector passes the window row's own id to ``ConversationLog.append``, which
    persists it in the same ``meta.mid`` shape — that copy carrying the id is the
    point: it IS the window row's flushed form and must match. A writer that passes
    no id persists no ``meta``, so its rows cannot be mistaken for a flushed window
    row.

    A disk read holding no ids at all needs a different boundary: a session
    persisted before ids existed, or rows a durable injector appended without
    going through a save. Walk the window and the disk read forward TOGETHER and
    stop at the first row that is not accounted for. A row from another writer no
    longer ENDS the run, which is what sizing the boundary as
    ``len(all_msgs) - slot._disk_older_count`` did — that measures the whole file,
    so a foreign append walked one row too far and dropped the owed turn. Both
    estimators the slot already carries are wrong here for opposite reasons: that
    subtraction over-counts, and ``_disk_window_len`` is not advanced by an
    injector, so it under-counts and would re-append a persisted row.

    The window is matched against the disk region as an ordered SUBSEQUENCE: a row
    that does not match the window row under consideration is SKIPPED rather than
    treated as the end of the window. The save is non-destructive against a
    cross-process append and merges the preserved rows back in TIME order
    (``_interleave_foreign_lines``), so the region can read
    ``[window, foreign, window]`` and an unmatched row means "not mine", not "end of
    window". Ending the run there leaves every persisted row after it in the tail,
    which appends an already-persisted suffix a second time.

    Skipping cannot pass over a row that should have matched: both sequences are
    chronological — the save's merge preserves each side's internal order — so a
    later window row's persisted copy cannot precede the current row's. It is also
    bounded: the disk cursor only ever moves forward, so the scans total
    O(window + region), and the first window row with no match anywhere in the
    remaining region ends the walk, which is the genuine end of the flushed prefix.

    A row matches on role plus content, compared through the redaction transform
    on both sides (``_same_persisted_body``). A shared ``ts`` is never SUFFICIENT —
    on a coarse clock two writers flooring off the same previous row both emit
    ``previous + 1µs`` (``history.py:1179-1219``), so accepting it alone drops an
    un-flushed message — but it is REQUIRED on the redaction-equivalent branch,
    where the only legitimate pair is a row and its own copy and the stamp is
    carried through verbatim.

    Ids are counted over the on-disk WINDOW REGION only,
    ``all_msgs[slot._disk_older_count:]``. The rows before that are the frozen prefix
    — on-disk rows older than the window, so none of them is in ``slot.messages``.
    Counting them would let an occurrence that exists only in the prefix fund a match
    for a window row that was never flushed, and the boundary would then walk past it.
    The fallback below already starts its disk cursor at the same offset.

    Id matching is selected only when EVERY row in that region carries a valid id, not
    merely when some row does. The dual-write injectors stamp both copies with one id
    (``slot.append`` mints it for the window copy and ``append_if_absent`` persists it
    on the durable copy), but the region can still legitimately hold a MIX: transcripts
    written before ids existed, and callers that pass no id. Choosing id matching on the
    strength of one id-carrying
    row then applies it to a row that structurally cannot match, which reads as
    un-flushed and appends the injection a second time. A mixed region belongs on the
    ordered path, which compares the fields both writers do record.

    Ids are matched as a MULTISET, one disk occurrence consumed per window row, not
    as a set. ``meta`` on an inbound message is caller-supplied and an id is minted
    only when one is *absent*, so a caller can post the same id twice. A set then
    matches EVERY window row carrying that id, so the boundary walks past a row that
    was never persisted and the response omits it — the silent-loss direction. One
    disk row is enough for that; two disk rows sharing an id are not required.
    Consuming an occurrence bounds the match to as many rows as really reached disk,
    and the earliest window row is the persisted one because flushes follow window
    order.

    Only string ids are matched. A truthy non-string ``mid`` survives to disk for the
    same caller-supplied reason and would raise ``TypeError`` if hashed.

    The id path selects the owed rows by MEMBERSHIP rather than by a prefix
    boundary. A boundary assumes every persisted row precedes every un-flushed one.
    When it does not, a later match moves the boundary past an un-flushed row and
    the response omits it — a drop, which is worse than the duplication this
    function exists to prevent. Ending the walk at the first miss is not the
    remedy either: a transient row is dropped by the save and so can never match,
    and stopping there re-appends every persisted row after it. Rows the client does
    not need are skipped outright (``_UNOWED_WINDOW_ROLES``), so selecting by
    membership cannot surface one the boundary happened to exclude; a pending
    ``permission`` row is deliberately not among them. Because an id in
    the disk window region proves that row reached disk, the owed set is simply the
    rows whose id did not, kept in window order. Where the persisted rows really
    are a prefix this returns the same answer, so it is a strict generalisation.

        # There are two ways to be owed, and both route to ``owed_rows``:
        #
        #   1. A TRANSIENT role. A disk read omits transient roles entirely, so such a
        #      row can NEVER be matched and is ALWAYS owed. Only ``_UNOWED_WINDOW_ROLES``
        #      (``done``/``queued``) and an already-answered ``permission`` are genuinely
        #      not owed.
        #   2. A non-transient row the forward scan does not find on disk. This used to
        #      ``break`` the loop outright, which left ``start`` pointing AT the unmatched
        #      row, so ``window[start:]`` re-emitted every LATER window row -- including
        #      rows already on disk. With a stop_event flushed before reply finalization
        #      (``_flush_segment`` re-appends the stop AFTER the finalized assistant row,
        #      see the note at the top of this function) the window reads
        #      ``[... unflushed reply, flushed stop]``: the reply missed, the loop broke,
        #      and the persisted stop came back a second time and out of order -- the
        #      very duplication this function exists to remove.
        #
        # The sibling id-carrying arm above already has the right rule, so mirror it
        # rather than inventing a second one: an unmatched row is held, a later match
        # flushes what is held at ITS disk position, and leftovers stay in the tail.
        # That keeps owed rows in window order instead of after the whole disk slice.
        #
        # Nothing is emitted twice: ``start`` only advances on a match, and a match flushes
        # ``owed_rows`` first, so every flushed row had an index below ``start``. Whatever
        # is left over sits at or after ``start`` and is carried by the trailing slice --
        # but that slice needs the unowed/answered exclusions applied to it as well, for
        # the reason recorded at the slice itself.

    """Build the stop_turn on_soft/on_hard callback that settles the stop card.

    Key the guard on `_stop_event_id`, not on `_stop_state`. The card id is
    already the idempotency token: `_resolve_stop_event` no-ops when it is None
    and clears it once it has settled the card, so a state gate buys nothing
    there. What the state gate did buy was a bug. A turn tearing down
    concurrently drives `_stop_state` back to "idle" (`_finish_queue_cycle` in
    chat_runner.py, through the `_stopping` setter in state.py), and that
    teardown races the escalation. When teardown won, the hard callback bailed,
    `_resolve_stop_event` never ran, and the card pulsed at "stopping" for the
    rest of the session instead of settling to "stop_failed_reset".

    Precedence needs its own non-racy marker. A cooperative ack that arrives
    after the user escalated must not relabel a hard kill as a clean stop, and
    `_stop_state` cannot carry that fact because the same teardown resets it to
    "idle" from `killing` just as readily as from `soft_pending`. Reading it
    here would reproduce the bug one dimension over: teardown erases the
    escalation, the late soft callback sees a neutral state, and the card
    settles as "stopped" for a session that was killed. So the escalation path
    sets `slot._stop_escalated_card_id`, which teardown never touches, and only
    the soft callback defers on it. `hard` is terminal and nothing outranks it.
    The marker holds an id rather than a flag so it cannot leak onto a later
    card: a bare boolean left set would make the NEXT card's cooperative ack
    defer to a hard callback that never fires, stranding that card at
    "stopping", which is the failure this change exists to remove.

    Bind to `card_id`, the specific card this callback was created for, and not
    to whatever card happens to be in flight when it fires. `stop_turn` awaits
    these callbacks, so one can still be pending when teardown resets the stop
    posture, a new turn starts, and a second stop opens a NEW card. Reading
    `slot._stop_event_id` at call time would then settle that newer card with
    this older outcome and clear its posture, so the newer stop's own callback
    would find nothing left to settle. Callers pass the id they just assigned.

    `card_id` may be None, for a stop that escalated before any card existed.
    Such a callback still releases the stop posture; it simply has no card to
    label. Only a mismatching non-None current id means "someone else owns
    this", so only that case returns without touching the slot.

    Two callers, one mechanism: picking up a turn that was cut short, and asking

    are indistinguishable from the transcript — a force-quit runs no ``finally``,
    so a killed turn leaves no error row behind and reads exactly like a
    completed one. ``_has_conversation`` authorizes; ``_is_interrupted`` only
    chooses which of the two continuation bodies the model receives.

    Runs the same synthetic-continuation machinery the runner already uses for
    its own post-transient recovery: queue the continuation at the head, then let
    ``_start_next_queued_turn`` land it as an ``inject`` row and dispatch the
    turn. No bespoke dispatch path, and the row folds into the existing recovery
    card instead of printing machine prose as a user bubble.

    The frontend decides whether to OFFER this (it has the transcript, `running`
    and the queue locally, so it needs no server field for that). This endpoint
    re-checks under ``slot._lock`` because the client's view is a WS snapshot and
    therefore lagging: a press landing in the instant a turn starts, or a second
    browser tab acting on a stale cache, would otherwise dispatch a duplicate
    turn against one slot — real tokens, real tool calls, real repo writes. Every
    other dispatch route guards the same way (see ``api_chat_slot_regenerate``).

    NOT readiness-gated, and that is deliberate — see
    ``kiro_readiness.reject_if_kiro_unverified``. Continue is an ordinary send: it
    queues one synthetic message and lets the runner dispatch it, mutating nothing
    durable up front, so the ACP attempt is its authority and a signed-out install
    reports ``AcpAuthRequired`` in the transcript. Gating it instead put the
    button behind a latch that is refreshed by re-probing ``kiro-cli``, and a
    probe that merely TIMES OUT reads as signed-out: on a host where that probe is
    slow the press was refused with a 503 forever while typing the same request by
    hand worked. The unequal treatment of two paths that dispatch the same turn is

    """Retire *name*'s auto-nudge loop and return it (None if it had none).

    Retire this slot's loop at the moment the user dismissed the tab. "Respect
    the close" used to be an emergent property of the fire path's rehydrate miss
    — and that is precisely the miss the fire path must now adopt through (see
    ``_fire_dashboard_nudge``'s ``adopt_closed``), or idle archival kills loops
    terminally. Making the user's ✕ the explicit retirement keeps the rule intact
    without relying on a cache miss to enforce it.

    The initial call MUST happen BEFORE the close path's first await, and the
    app-owned path calls it again after its close hook. Two reasons, both of
    which resurrect a session the user closed:

    * The loop's timer can EXPIRE during an await of the close (the turn-cancel
      wait, the history persist, the session teardown). The slot is already out
      of ``state._slots`` by then, so the fire path takes its rehydrate branch
      and restores the transcript with ``adopt_closed=True`` — the very
      transcript the persist is marking closed.
    * Cancelling ``slot.task`` runs ``_run_chat``'s finally, which re-arms the
      timer through ``notify_turn_complete``. Disarming without removing is
      therefore not enough: the clock comes straight back mid-close.

    ``remove_by_slot()`` is what makes this generation-safe: it acquires the
    maintenance transaction before resolving the current loop, so a queued arm
    either lands first and is removed or runs after the synchronous slot pop.
    Its uncontended acquire does not yield, so the initial retirement also
    cancels a scheduled timer before the fire callback gets another turn.

    The returned loop is the only remaining record of it — the persist-failure
    path uses it to put the clock back (see :func:`_restore_slot_nudge_loop`).

    A removal that FAILS raises :exc:`_NudgeRetireFailed` rather than logging and
    carrying on. Removal drops the loop from memory first and only then writes
    the registry, so a write that raises leaves memory retired while the DISK
    still lists the loop. Swallowing that let the close finish and persist
    the slot as closed, and the next start read the surviving record back: the
    fire path answers the missing slot with ``adopt_closed=True``, so the loop
    rebuilt the dismissed session and ran an unattended turn in it. Locating a
    session the user closed is exactly the outcome this function exists to
    prevent, so the close must not proceed on a half-applied retirement.

    Drops the slot's resume pointer, so its next turn cold-starts a new native
    conversation instead of ``session/load``-ing the accumulated one. Everything
    else survives: the slot stays open, its transcript stays on disk, and the
    session-map ENTRY keeps its channel linkage.

    This capability existed internally with no way to ask for it. Resume is
    key-driven — ``resume_sid = self._session_map.get(key)`` — and a slot key is
    stable by design, so reopening one continues where it left off. That is the
    point for a tab the user closed and came back to. It is NOT what a caller
    wants after a long-lived conversation has drifted, filled up, or outlived the
    thing it was about; and until now the only way to break the link was to
    DELETE the session from history, which destroys the record to reset the
    pointer. This separates the two.

    ``discard_conversation``, not ``destroy``: the entry also carries the Slack
    thread/channel linkage and the reverse index built from it, so dropping the
    row would silently unlink a mirrored session. The dropped value is stashed as
    ``discarded_sid``, so this is diagnosable and reversible by hand.

    It is nonetheless a FULL teardown — it shuts the provider down and releases
    the shared sub-agent runtime — so it takes the same guards the sibling
    teardown route does, through the same shared helpers rather than a third
    policy of its own: authorization on the SESSION (not merely the slot),
    ``provider.has_active_turn()``, ``running`` widened with
    ``_in_stage_execution``, and the sub-agent gate. Each of the four protects
    work the caller cannot see from the outside: a turn running on the session
    with no dashboard task behind it (an inbound channel message), a turn
    mid-write, a plan between stages, and children still running after their
    parent's turn ended.

    ``has_active_turn`` is the probe the reload route uses for this same teardown,
    and it inherits that probe's edge: a turn holding the per-session semaphore
    but not yet having a prompt in flight is not seen. Matching the sibling is
    deliberate — a second, subtly different notion of "busy" for one teardown is
    how the two drift apart.

    The transcript is deliberately left in place, which means the tab still shows
    the earlier messages while the model no longer remembers them. That is the
    honest rendering of what happened — the record is the user's, the context was
    the conversation's — and it is why this is a deliberate action rather than
    something the gateway does on its own.

    ``local-app``). A dashboard token issued for a different subject would

    Apps can only touch slots they own; dashboard users (empty ``request_app``)
    can touch everything. The denial is a 404 rather than a 403 so a non-owning
    app token cannot use the status code to probe which slots exist -- the SEL
    event still records the real reason.

    Owning the slot is not sufficient, because it does not imply owning the
    session the write lands on. ``get_or_create_slot`` sets ``_app`` from its
    caller and, for a name shaped like a channel session stem, resolves
    ``linked_session_key`` from the session map in the same call -- so an app
    that names a live channel thread ends up owning a slot bound to a
    conversation it has no claim on. Both callers of
    this gate write into that session: the visible row lands in the channel's
    own transcript and the queued half drains into its next turn. Ownership
    alone would turn a slot binding into capability escalation, which is the
    same second condition ``_app_cancel_denied`` already applies to /stop.

    That session check cannot fire for an UNBOUND channel slot, and the write
    does not follow the session there. When ``surface_channel_session`` cannot
    resolve a thread's key it surfaces the slot with ``linked_session_key``
    empty and ``channel_origin`` set, so ``effective_session_key`` falls back to
    ``_history_key_for`` and the condition above compares a value against
    itself. ``slot_history_key`` does not: it resolves a ``channel_origin`` slot
    through ``slot_transcript_key``, onto the channel's own transcript. So the
    visible row lands in a foreign conversation while the slot's session
    identity stays local and every session-shaped check passes. The third
    condition therefore tests the TRANSCRIPT key -- the thing the write actually
    addresses -- which is the discipline ``_app_cancel_denied`` states at
    :2299-2301: authorize the key the caller will really act on, so
    authorization and action cannot disagree.

    A background actor (a cron, an app) uses this to drop a short, DECLARATIVE
    note into a chat that is both (a) visible in the transcript right away and
    (b) known to the agent if the user later asks about it -- WITHOUT firing an
    LLM turn.

    A plain transcript append is not enough on its own: a live provider holds its
    own in-memory conversation state and a normal send forwards only the new user
    message, so a row written via ``slot.append()`` alone is never seen by the
    model. The channel that IS seen is ``_pending_context``, which is drained and
    prepended to the next user message. So the endpoint does two writes against
    the same slot:

    1. visible line -- ``slot.append(role="inject", cls="reconcile-note")`` so it
       renders in the transcript and persists.
    2. context entry -- a ``_pending_context`` entry (the same channel
       ``/context`` uses) drained onto the user's next manual message exactly
       once, then cleared.

    Both writes always happen. A context-only write is ``POST /context``, which
    already exists; there is no visible-only mode, because no caller wanted one.

    A session reset in between can replay the transcript row into the new
    session, so the model may see the note twice in one prompt. The queued copy
    is kept regardless: the replay is char-budget bounded, so dropping it would
    lose an older note the replay had already trimmed away.

    Notes are meant to be declarative -- state what happened, never ask. An
    interrogative note rides along as background context and may get answered on
    the next unrelated turn. The context half defaults to a 24h ``maxAge`` so a
    never-followed-up note self-expires; the visible line is permanent.

    Body::

        {
            "content": "...",         // required, declarative, non-empty string
            "source": "board-sync",   // optional frame label + per-source cap bucket;
                                      //   <=64 chars, no control chars; empty -> "note"
            "maxAge": 86400,          // optional seconds; omitted -> 24h default.
                                      //   Explicit null -> no expiry, as on /context.
            "ephemeral": true         // optional, default true (passed to the context entry)
        }

    Returns ``{"ok", "appended", "visibleDeferred", "contextSkipped", "pending"}``.
    If the source's per-source context cap is already full the visible line is
    still written and ``contextSkipped`` is true: the cap protects the context
    queue, not the transcript, so the call is NOT 429'd.

    When a turn is already running BOTH halves are held and written at that
    turn's end, so ``appended`` is false and ``visibleDeferred`` is true. Its
    order is preserved and it is not dropped while this gateway stays up -- the
    hold is in memory, so a 200 means accepted for this gateway lifetime, not
    durable delivery.
    Appending mid-turn would take the row the replay path skips and cause the
    user's own request to be replayed; queueing the context mid-turn would let
    the turn already in flight drain it, so the note would shape the request it
    was written after and the next turn would find nothing. Every rejection
    still happens on the POST. ``pending`` counts held entries too, so it always
    reports what the model will receive. Holding more than
    ``_MAX_DEFERRED_NOTES`` on one turn is a 429 ``deferred_notes_full``.
