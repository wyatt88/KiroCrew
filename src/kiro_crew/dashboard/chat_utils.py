    A pause retains the thread binding, so every inbound resolver still sees the

    one predicate that tells outbound egress apart from that: consult it before
    SENDING, never before routing. Gating a routing decision on it would fork a
    new session out of a reply the user expected to continue this one.

    Scope is deliberately turn mirroring — the user echo, its tool stream, the
    assistant reply, an auth-required error and the linked approval prompt.
    Deliveries that merely reuse the thread as an ADDRESS (a cron result, a
    subagent completion, a requested file, an auto-nudge tick) are NOT gated: an
    absent link makes those fall back to the owner's DM, and one of them deletes
    the auto-nudge loop outright, so treating paused as no-link there would
    reroute messages the user asked for and destroy a live monitor.

    The channel compaction notice is also not gated, and belongs with the
    address-based deliveries above rather than with turn output: it reports that
    the session's own history was compacted, which stays true whether or not the
    conversation is currently connected. (An earlier version of this note claimed

    Origin rows now DO carry one, so that reasoning is void — the exclusion
    stands on the delivery's kind, not on the row's affordances.)

    Strict ``is True`` rather than truthiness, and fails OPEN: ``sessions`` is a
    bare ``MagicMock`` across much of the suite and returns a truthy child for

    and they mute independently. Callers that resolve a single outbound target

    The defect: the model emits an invoke block into its TEXT channel instead
    of executing it (observed when the target is a deferred MCP tool whose
    schema is not yet bound, and with large nested arguments), the turn then
    ends with zero tool calls, and the session idles — in a monitor/autonudge
    loop this is a silent stall the user only discovers by noticing nothing
    happened.

    NOTICE-ONLY, deliberately. An injected "re-issue that call" continuation
    would carry runtime authority into a session where the call can execute
    with no human gate — slot trust, global yolo, OR a static agent tool
    allowlist all auto-approve it, and the last of these is invisible at this
    layer, so no downgrade condition can be written here that fails closed.
    The leaked block is also not proof of the model's own intent: untrusted
    external content (a pasted issue, a fetched page quoting a leak) can carry
    an unfenced block the model merely reproduces. So the turn is marked
    un-landed and the user gets a visible card naming what happened; nothing
    is queued and nothing can execute. An unattended loop loses one cycle and
    retries on its own schedule — visibly, which is the half of the defect this
    layer can fix honestly.

    Gates: the turn ended NORMALLY (cancel/refusal/error paths own their own
    reporting), made ZERO tool calls — not because a tool-heavy turn is a
    different shape (it is the same leak) but because THIS path un-lands the
    turn, and a turn whose earlier calls had real side effects must not be
    marked unacted; that shape is noticed without un-landing by
    :func:`should_notice_mixed_turn_leak` — is top-level, is NOT a
    stage-execution turn (the orchestrator's stage loop reads the turn result
    for stage accounting, and un-landing a stage turn from here would let the
    loop record an unfinished stage as complete — same exclusion as the
    promise-only guard), and its final segment carries the machine-shaped
    leak (:func:`has_leaked_tool_call`). No one-shot budget: nothing is

    The shape :func:`should_notice_leaked_tool_call` deliberately declines: the

    ``turn_tool_calls == 0`` gate exists to protect UN-LANDING — earlier calls
    in the turn may already have taken effect, so marking it unacted could
    misdescribe it — and that reasoning is untouched here. This predicate
    governs only the user-visible NOTICE, which carries no such hazard: nothing
    is queued, nothing is un-landed, nothing executes.

    Why the notice is worth a card on a shape that lands normally: the mixed
    turn hides the gap BETTER than the zero-call one, not worse. The model
    reads state, announces the write, leaks the write, and the reply lands
    looking like a completed action — some of the work may already have
    happened, so there is no stall to notice and no missing output to explain.
    Before this the only trace was a gateway log line, which the person in the
    chat does not read.

    Conditions are EXACTLY the ones the runner already used for its diagnostic
    log, so the set of diagnosed turns does not move — only their visibility:
    at least one dispatched tool call, a NORMAL end-turn (which excludes the
    cancelled stop reason), top-level, and a final segment carrying the
    machine-shaped leak (:func:`has_leaked_tool_call`).

    Deliberately NOT gated on ``in_stage_execution``, unlike its sibling: that
    exclusion exists so the orchestrator's stage loop cannot read an unfinished
    stage as complete, and a notice-only card changes no turn result the loop
    reads. One mismatch follows and is accepted: the card's guidance ("check
    what landed before re-sending") addresses a human driving the chat, not the
    stage loop, so on a stage-execution turn it offers advice its reader cannot
    act on — harmless, and better than hiding the leak on those turns.

    The card says the earlier calls were ATTEMPTED rather than ran, and never
    "nothing was run" as the sibling does, because ``turn_tool_calls`` counts
    dispatches at the tool-call event, before approval — a refused call
    increments it too. The count bounds what may have landed rather than
    asserting any of it did, and a reader who took "nothing was run" literally
    here would redo work that already took effect.

    ``turn_tool_calls`` is REQUIRED, unlike the sibling's defaulted parameter:
    zero is that one's firing shape but this one's refusing shape, so a default
    here would silently disable the predicate rather than exercise it.

        ``end_turn``; re-queueing then would dispatch the very action the user
        tried to stop. Every sibling recovery path gates on this, so this one

      * NO Stop was pressed at ANY point during this turn

        snapshotted at turn start still matches). A Stop that pressed AND

        it by falling through to a normal landing instead of overriding it;
      * NO mid-turn steer is pending (``no_pending_steers``). A steer lands in
        ``slot._pending_steers``, a SEPARATE channel from ``_queue``; it is only
        degraded into a queue card in ``_run_chat``'s ``finally``, which runs
        AFTER this guard. So a "don't delete" steer is invisible to
        ``queue_empty`` here, and firing recovery would schedule the announced

      * the turn made NO tool calls (``turn_tool_calls == 0``). The segment-buffer
        reset at each tool boundary is not an airtight "never replay an executed
        action" proxy on its own: a turn that completed a side-effecting tool
        (e.g. ``send_message``) and then emitted trailing promise-shaped text
        ("I'll send that now") still matches the detector, and the continuation
        would REISSUE the completed action (duplicate external message). The
        promise-only bug is by definition a turn that announced an action and made
        NO tool call, so requiring a zero tool-call count closes the replay hole
        directly. A turn that ran a read then promised a further action is excluded
        too — a false negative, which is the safe direction;

        buffer at every tool boundary, ``final_segment_text`` is exactly the text

        summarised has a summary here, not a promise; the ``turn_tool_calls`` gate
        above is the airtight backstop for the same guarantee;
      * this is NOT a stage-execution turn (``in_stage_execution``). A turn run by
        the orchestrator's stage loop must not spawn async recovery: the loop
        records the stage complete and advances before the continuation finishes,

    The scenario: the backend hit its context ceiling PART WAY THROUGH a turn,

    finishing the work it was doing. The compaction succeeded, so nothing
    reports an error and the turn lands as a clean ``end_turn`` with a settled
    footer — the request is simply abandoned, and the chat appears to stop dead.
    kiro-cli re-sends the pending request itself after compacting; the Claude
    backend does not, so the recovery has to live here.

    Unlike :func:`should_recover_promise_only` this needs no text detector and
    is deliberately NOT gated on ``turn_tool_calls == 0``: a mid-turn compaction
    is a hard fact reported by the backend, not a guess about what prose meant,
    and the turns that overflow the window are precisely the long tool-heavy
    ones. Re-dispatch safety comes from the continuation's own wording, which
    tells the model the summary records completed work and not to re-run it.

      * a compaction STARTED and COMPLETED inside this turn
        (``compaction_started``/``compaction_settled``) — the turn really was
        interrupted by one, rather than merely following one. ``compaction_settled``
        means the COMPLETED terminal specifically, not any terminal: a compaction
        that FAILED also ends, and continuing after one would assert a summary
        exists when the context was never summarized;
      * the user did NOT ask for it (``user_requested_compaction`` is False for
        anything but an explicit ``/compact``). A deliberate ``/compact`` has
        done exactly what was asked and must land quietly; auto-continuing it
        would turn a housekeeping command into an unrequested turn;
      * the turn produced NO answer of its own after the compaction
        (``final_segment_text`` is blank). A backend that DID resume and finish
        leaves text here, so this is also what keeps the fix from double-
        prompting a backend that self-heals. A compaction NOTICE does not count
        as such an answer: the Claude adapter ships it as ordinary assistant text
        and nothing deletes the chunk, so the ACP layer flags it
        (``AcpEvent.control_notice``) and the caller SUBTRACTS the flagged chunks
        from the segment text it passes here. Subtracting at this one call rather
        than suppressing the chunk upstream is deliberate: the notice must still
        stream and persist, so the text path stays untouched and only this gate —
        the one reader that asks "did the turn answer?" — discounts it;
      * the turn ended NORMALLY (``end_turn``), was not cancelled, and carried
        no tool refusals — those have their own paths;
      * no Stop is in progress, no Stop was pressed at any point in the turn,
        no user follow-up is queued, and no mid-turn steer is pending. Same four

        overflows the window again, an unbounded version would compact and
        continue forever.

    process holds the loopback callback listener and the PKCE verifier the code
    is exchanged with. A child can die without any code of ours running at a

    RSS recycle, or the child simply exiting. Revalidating on every read is the
    same discipline ``connections.mint.expire_dead_holder`` already applies to
    the mint feed, instead of trying to enumerate every way a flow can end.

    ``live_child`` is the process-instance identity of the child CURRENTLY
    serving the slot, resolved by the caller (empty when there is no live
    child). It is a per-spawn token, never the ACP session id: a resume carries
    the same session id onto a NEW process, so a session-id comparison would
    fail open exactly when the minting process is gone.

    * the row still carries an ``oauth_url`` — there is a live-looking button to

      ``superseded`` are authoritative outcomes recorded by the process that
      observed them, and a later read must not reinterpret them.
    * the row's ``child`` stamp does not name the live child.

    A row carrying NO ``child`` stamp is treated as stale, and that is a
    deduction rather than a guess: the stamp is written by the same build that
    reads it, so an unstamped row was persisted by an older build — and running
    this build means this process replaced the one that hosted that row's
    child. The effect is that the fix also retires banners that went stale
