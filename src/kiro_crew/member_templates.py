"""Crew templates: the store listing a crew member is hired from.

A template is an installed app's Custom Agent plus the job card its manifest's
``crew`` section carries (:class:`kiro_crew.apps.manifest.CrewTemplate`). This
module is the read side the hire route composes:

* :func:`resolve_store_template` -- from ``{app, agent}`` to the materialized
  agent file (``<app>--<agent>``, the copy ``apps.bridges`` writes into the
  agents directory when the app is enabled), the card, the version, the agent
  definition and the initial briefing text.
* :func:`template_ref` -- the ``template`` the wrapper row records
  (``<app>/<agent>``), the same namespacing the materialized file uses.
* :func:`write_pristine_copy` -- the unmodified template payload at the
  installed version, kept at ``members/<slug>/template.json`` so a later role
  update can three-way merge (BASE = this file, MINE = the member's agent file,
  THEIRS = the new version). The reader arrives with that update.
* :func:`seed_briefing` -- copy ``initial_briefing`` ONCE into the member's own
  ``briefing.md``; from then on the file is the member's lived state and no
  template operation touches it.

Leaf-ish on purpose: imports the manifest, the members module and the agents
directory resolver, never the dashboard handlers.
