"""OS-level sandbox for agent child processes.

Hides sensitive credential paths (``~/.aws``, ``~/.gnupg``, etc.) from the
kiro-cli subprocess tree and exposes ``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` while hiding
other SSH files (keys, config, etc.), using platform-native isolation:

- **Linux**: fork → ``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`` → parent writes identity
  UID/GID map → ``unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)`` → bind-mount empty dirs → exec.
  The child retains the real UID so all toolchains work normally.
- **macOS**: ``sandbox-exec`` with a Seatbelt profile that denies reads

The parent KiroCrew process is completely unaffected — isolation applies
only to the spawned child.  Falls back gracefully to no sandbox when the
OS mechanism is unavailable (logged as warning).

Config: ``"sandbox": "auto" | "off"`` in ``~/.kiro/crew/config.json``.
``"auto"`` (default) uses namespace sandbox on Linux, seatbelt on macOS.

# ── The crew data home's governance tree, reconciled with security.py ──
#
# ``security.sensitive_home_dirs()`` is the AGENT-TOOL gate: it is what
# ``is_sensitive_path`` refuses for a file_read/file_write tool call. The lists in this
# module are a SEPARATE, OS-level gate — a spawned ``python -c`` or a shell command does
# an ``open()`` that never routes through the tool gate, so a path fenced only there is
# readable through any sandbox mode. Two entries (``.vault``, ``policy_cache``) were
# already carried in both; the rest of the governance tree was not, which left the
# ceiling itself (``security_policy.json``) readable and WRITABLE from an app lifecycle
# script, a script hook, or a command cron.
#
# Reconciling the two is NOT a union, and the reason is specific: Kiro Crew's own MCP
# servers (``mcp_core``, ``mcp_cron``, ``mcp_computer``) are spawned by kiro-cli UNDER
# this launcher and share the agent's mount namespace, as does a script cron's
# ``boot_platform()``. Whatever they open at OS level cannot be masked. So each crew-home
# leaf gets one of three dispositions:
#
#   HIDDEN    Nothing that runs inside the sandbox reads it. An empty dir/file is
#             bind-mounted over it, in EVERY mode — the treatment ``.vault`` already
#             gets, for the same reason.
#   READONLY  In-sandbox code READS it and a WRITE would let the agent choose its own
#             ceiling. Hiding a ceiling is the WRONG direction: an absent policy file
#             resolves to the permissive standalone default, so masking
#             ``security_policy.json`` from the process that enforces it REMOVES the
#             ceiling instead of protecting it. Exposed read-only instead, which is what
#             ``policy_cache`` already does.
#   VISIBLE   In-sandbox code needs READ *and* WRITE, so no OS rule can apply without
#             breaking it. These stay on the tool gate alone.
#
# ``test_sandbox_governance_mask.py`` pins the union of the three equal to the crew-home
# half of ``security.sensitive_home_dirs()``, so a leaf added there cannot silently land
# in none of them. Spelled here rather than imported so this low-level module keeps not
# importing the 7k-line security module (the ``_POLICY_CACHE_LEAF`` convention above).

#: The live-target pointer's file name under the crew data home.
#:
#: The pointer names the checkout the gateway execs into at startup, so it is masked from
#: EVERY sandboxed process — including Dev Fleet's own backend, whose cutover runs in the gateway.
#: That backend is a sandboxed spawn whose ``npm ci`` / build children run inside the same
#: namespace (a nested sandbox is denied by design), so any leaf it could reach, a
#: worktree's lifecycle script could reach too. The cutover therefore runs in the gateway
#: process (``dev_fleet/gateway_routes.py``) and the mask here stays whole; what this
#: module adds is a MOUNT TARGET for it (:func:`_materialize_live_target_mask_target`), so
#: the mask is never vacuous on a host that has not pinned a target yet. Spelled here
#: rather than imported from ``service.live_target`` to keep this low-level module free of
#: that import chain; ``test_sandbox_dev_fleet_live_target.py`` pins the spellings equal.
_LIVE_TARGET_LEAF: str = "live_target.json"
#: The masked DIRECTORY the pointer's absent-equivalent stub is staged in before it is
#: linked into place. Staging beside the target — in the data-home root — would put the
#: temp at a name every sandbox can see: a concurrent namespace could ``link(2)`` it and
#: keep a second, writable path to the inode the gateway later reads, and a bind mask
#: covers a PATH, not an inode. A hidden directory covers every name inside it, present
#: and future, so the temp is never visible; :func:`_materialize_live_target_mask_target`

_LIVE_TARGET_STAGING_LEAF: str = "live-target-staging"

    beneath an independently masked directory takes that whole foreign mask
    down with it — a data home relocated beneath a credential directory (e.g.
    ``KIROCREW_HOME`` under ``~/.aws``) would hand every spawn that asks for a
    crew-home carve-out the entire credential tree. Both EQUALITY-shaped
    crew-home carve-out producers call this before adding a spelling —
    :func:`app_backend_visible_targets` and the policy-cache site in
    ``apps/backend.py``. (The aws-control per-call staging carve-out is the
    ANCESTOR-LIFT shape — its temp dir is a proper descendant of its own mask
    by design — so this guard as written would refuse it on every layout, and
    it has no own-ancestor-exempt variant.) On refusal the mask stays

    state, an unreadable cache for a cache-only backend), which is strictly
    safer than unmasking a foreign tree. The refusal is logged with the
    offending ancestor so the misconfiguration is actionable.

    The mask universe is the EFFECTIVE tier's dir list — *mode* run through the
    same ``sandbox.min_level`` clamp :func:`wrap_argv` applies (see
    :func:`effective_sandbox_mode`) — NOT the union of every tier: ``standard``
    deliberately leaves ``~/.aws`` visible, so a data home relocated beneath it
    shadows nothing in an ungoverned standard-mode spawn, and refusing there
    would break the carve-out's consumer for zero security gain. A governed
    floor that clamps the spawn up is honoured by construction, because the
    clamp result is what selects the list. Two deliberate asymmetries, both in
    the refusal direction: ``cc`` uses the launcher's list on every platform
    (the macOS profile builder drops ``.aws`` from it in favour of file-level
    rules, so macOS ``cc`` can only over-refuse), and a tier that cannot be
    resolved falls back to the union of every tier. The relocated mask entries
    the builders add in every mode are included on BOTH paths, so a carve-out
    leaf beneath a relocated wholesale mask is judged against it too. Two
    builder additions are deliberately absent: ``_voice_runtime_sandbox_paths``
    (fixed runtime sockets no crew-home carve-out can sit beneath) and a
    caller's ``extra_hidden_dirs`` (neither guarded producer's spawn passes
    any).

    The floor is re-read by ``wrap_argv`` at wrap time; a floor RAISED in the
    interval between this check and the wrap is honoured for the masks but not
    for this refusal. Exploiting that window requires an operator to both
    tighten governance and have already relocated the data home beneath a
    newly-masked tree — operator actions, not agent-reachable ones.

    Equality is not shadowing — carve-out spellings ARE masked entries, and
    unhiding exactly themselves is the carve-out's whole job; only a PROPER
    ancestor is foreign.

    Fails toward refusal, never raises: when home (or the path itself) cannot
    be resolved the mask universe cannot be checked, so the spelling is

#: Materialising the path first closes it, and that is only sound for a leaf that
#: clears BOTH of the following.
#:
#: 1. An EMPTY document must mean what an ABSENT file means to the reader:
#:
#:    * ``profiles`` — an empty dir yields no profile, same as no dir;
#:    * ``member-memory-bindings`` — an empty dir identifies no runs; its
#:      directory bind shows records the gateway publishes later without
#:      granting agent processes the ability to create or replace one;
#:    * ``playwright-cli`` — an empty dir means the launcher is absent,
#:      exactly as a missing dir does; its directory bind shows a later gateway
#:      install while withholding every agent-side write;
#:    * ``computer_use.json`` — ``computer_use.enable_state.load_state`` reads ``{}``
#:      as DISABLED, which is what an absent keystone means;
#:    * ``oauth_endpoints.json`` — ``security._validate_operator_oauth_entries``
#:      extends trust by nothing for ``{}``;
#:    * ``aws_service_consent.json`` — ``aws_consent._read_all`` returns ``{}`` for
#:      both absent and empty, so every service stays unconfirmed;
#:    * ``settings_seeds.json`` — ``acp.seed_provenance._load`` finds no ``seeds``
#:      mapping in ``{}`` and returns having recorded nothing, so every settings
#:      path reads as unowned. Identical to absent, and the leaf that most needs
#:      materialising: it is written only once a claude-agent-acp session has
#:      actually seeded a work dir, so on every install that has not it is exactly
#:      the absent-and-therefore-writable name this list exists to close.
#:
#: 2. A STALE read of that empty document must fail toward refusal. The seal is a
#:    bind mount, which pins the INODE for the sandbox's lifetime, while every
#:    dashboard writer publishes through ``atomic_write`` (temp + rename), i.e. a NEW
#:    inode. So a sandboxed reader keeps seeing the empty document even after the
#:    operator writes the real one. For the three JSON files above that freezes them at
#:    "disabled" / "no consent" / "no extra endpoints" — narrower than the truth, and
#:    for ``settings_seeds.json`` at "Crew owns no settings file", so the writer takes
#:    its leave-it-alone branch: the seed is not refreshed, and nothing is overwritten
#:    or unlinked. The empty ``profiles`` dir is exempt from the concern entirely: a
#:    directory bind shows live contents, so a profile added later is visible.
#:
#: DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED, and each for a different one of those two reasons:
#:
#:   * ``denied_commands.json`` — clears (1) but fails (2), which is the direction
#:     that matters: in-sandbox ``mcp_cron`` reads it to decide whether a command is
#:     denied, so a pinned ``{}`` would report "nothing is denied" for the rest of the
#:     sandbox's life even after the operator denies a command. Sealing it would trade
#:     an agent-authored deny list for a stale one, so it keeps the pre-existing gap;
#:   * ``security_policy.json`` — fails (1). ``governance.load_security_policy`` reads
#:     the file whenever it exists and fails CLOSED on a parse or version mismatch, so
#:     a ``{}`` stub raises ``PlatformCompositionError`` out of a function that runs at
#:     boot AND per app callback;
#:   * ``app_admission.json`` — fails (1). Absent means ``open_default()`` (admit),
#:     while present-but-unreadable means deny-all; a stub would refuse every app;
#:   * ``admission_policy.json`` — already seeded at first run by
#:     ``platform.admission.seed_default_policy``, so it is not absent to begin with.
#:
#: The same ``mount(2)`` limit leaves the ``SENSITIVE_DIRS`` / ``SENSITIVE_FILES``
#: mask loops skipping their own absent targets. That is a real sibling gap, not one
#: this list closes: a mask needs the opposite treatment (an empty bind OVER the
#: name), and ``_CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`` has no reader to prove an empty document is

    * the ceiling is a **symlink**. The launcher seals the inode it resolves to, but the

    a config file has a second name — a dotfile manager such as chezmoi or GNU stow, or a

    Runs on the Linux spawn path only, immediately before the launcher builds its
    ``READONLY_DIRS`` mount sequence, so a ceiling that did not exist a moment ago is
    a read-only mountpoint by the time the sandboxed command runs.

    **Fail-closed.** If a ceiling cannot be made sealable this raises
    :class:`SandboxCeilingUnsealable` and the spawn does not happen. That is a
    deliberate reversal of an earlier best-effort version, which warned and continued:
    continuing means the launcher's ``os.path.exists`` guard skips the path, so the
    sandboxed process runs with a writable governance keystone and nothing downstream
    notices. An unsealed ceiling is the one thing this function exists to prevent, so it
    refuses for the same reason ``_mount_or_die`` refuses a failed hiding mount.

    Two states trigger it:

    * a **dangling symlink** squatting a ceiling path. ``os.path.exists`` follows
      symlinks, so it reads as absent to this function AND to the launcher's guard,
      while ``os.link`` refuses the name as ``EEXIST`` — the sandboxed process's write
      then follows the link and the host reads the result back through the ceiling path.
      It is not removed here: ``islink`` followed by ``unlink`` is not atomic, and the
      dashboard publishes a real keystone over that same name with ``atomic_write``, so
      a removal racing a validated operator write would delete the operator's new
      settings. POSIX offers no unlink-only-if-still-a-symlink, so the safe answer is to
      refuse and let a human resolve it;
    * a **creation failure** other than ``EEXIST`` — a read-only mount, or a filesystem
      with no hardlink support.

    ``EEXIST`` is benign for ordinary ceilings: another spawn or the operator won
    the race and the launcher seals the winner. Strict executable directories have
    a higher bar. Their winner is re-checked with ``lstat`` and must be a real
    directory, because a symlink would move the mount off the name the gateway later
    resolves.

def _pod_os_home_targets(dirs: tuple[str, ...]) -> list[str]:
    """The sensitive-dir list re-anchored under a pod child's REMAPPED home.

    Sibling of :func:`_relocated_crew_targets`, for the other root that moves.
    ``acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap`` gives a pod's kiro-cli child a pod-owned
    ``HOME`` (``KIROCREW_OS_HOME``) so its OAuth grants die with the pod, and
    ``pod.runtime._seed_pod_os_home`` mirrors the runtime's identity store into it
    (no host SSO cache contents are copied). Those are credentials, and every entry
    in the tier lists is ``$HOME``-relative joined
    against ``Path.home()`` -- the GATEWAY's home -- so none of them named the
    remapped tree and the seeded token sat in an UNMASKED location that the child's
    own ``$HOME`` resolves to.

    **Why this lives here rather than in the two ACP transports.** Both of them
    build their sandbox BEFORE applying the remap, so feeding the paths in through
    ``extra_hidden_dirs`` would need the call order changed in two places and the
    path set restated in both -- two independent copies of one rule, which is the
    duplication rounds 8 and 9 removed from the pinned-write path. Computing it
    inside the mask builder instead makes the mask correct for EVERY caller
    regardless of when the remap runs, and re-anchors whichever tier list the
    caller's mode selected rather than a hand-copied subset of it.

    Gated on ``KIROCREW_POD == "1"`` exactly as ``config.paths`` gates the
    resolver, so a non-pod session's mask is byte-identical to before. Returns only
    paths that DIFFER from the ``$HOME``-relative spelling, so the default layout
    gains no duplicate rule.

    ``normpath``, never ``realpath``, for the reason :func:`_relocated_crew_targets`
    records: this runs on the event loop for every async spawn. Never raises -- an
    unresolvable value yields nothing and the ``$HOME``-relative entries still apply.

    **One leaf is deliberately NOT re-anchored: the pod's own grant store.**
    ``<os-home>/.aws`` is where the pod's kiro-cli child writes its OWN MCP OAuth
    grants, which ``mcp_grant`` then stats through
    ``config.paths.kiro_oauth_cache_home``. No host SSO cache contents are staged
    into it -- ``_seed_pod_os_home`` creates ``.aws/sso/cache`` EMPTY, and the
    earlier revision that copied the operator's tokens there was deleted -- so what
    the tree holds is grants that pod itself minted. Bind-masking it empty still
    breaks the feature: the child's grant writes land in the overlay instead of the
    pod tree, so ``grant_presence`` answers "no grant" forever. A read-only per-file
    re-expose (the ``expose_files`` primitive) cannot substitute, because the child
    needs WRITE access and the grant filenames are sha256 keys that do not exist
    until the child mints them -- there is nothing to enumerate at launcher-build
    time.

    What that costs, stated rather than implied: an agent tool call inside the pod
    can read the grants that pod minted. That is accepted here because it is
    strictly narrower than both baselines it replaces -- a pod child resolving the
    REAL ``~/.aws/sso/cache``, and a non-pod kiro-cli child is
    exposed the real credential homes by the standard tier for exactly this sign-in
    reason. The tree is created by the pod and reclaimed by ``pod down``.

    **A SECOND tree carries the same residual, and it is host-derived rather than
    pod-minted: the staged identity store.** ``_seed_pod_os_home`` snapshots the
    runtime identity store (``.local/share/{kiro-cli,amazon-q}`` and the platform
    siblings, from ``identity_stores.store_mappings``) into the pod home, because
    that is where the harness resolves its access token and a pod with no copy boots
    signed-out. Those rows are absent from every masking tier ON PURPOSE --
    ``test_the_agent_runtime_auth_stores_stay_visible`` pins them out, because the
    harness is itself spawned inside this sandbox -- so this function emits nothing
    for them and an agent shell descendant can read the staged bearer token.

    That is NOT closed here, and the reason is structural rather than an oversight:
    a bind-mask acts on a MOUNT NAMESPACE, and the harness and the tool subprocesses
    it spawns share one. Hiding the store from the agent's shell hides it from
    kiro-cli in the same act, which is the auth break the tier exclusion exists to
    avoid. Crew owns no seam between the two audiences -- it wraps the harness, and
    the harness spawns its own tools inside that wrapper. The layer that DOES
    separate them is the tool gate: ``security.is_sensitive_path`` refuses every
    staged store path (``identity_stores.fenced_home_dirs`` is spliced into
    ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`` and re-anchored under ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME``), so a
    tool call naming the path is denied and only a raw ``open()`` inside a spawned
    shell reaches it.

    **The command matcher is not a second opinion on this, for ANY path.**
    ``is_sensitive_bash_command`` carries a size ceiling, an IMDS check and an
    environment-credential exfiltration check, and no path matcher at all.
    Measured, it answers ALLOW for every path spelling -- ``~/.aws/credentials``
    and ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` included -- so the pod tree is not a special case
    there. What bounds a shell is this mask and nothing else, which is
    exactly why the carve-outs above are the interesting part of this function.

    Pinned in both directions by
    ``test_pod_runtime_auth_store.py::TestTheStagedStoresResidualIsPinned``; closing
    the staged store's shell leg needs a pod-scoped sign-in that never places a host
    bearer in the pod tree, which is a design change rather than a mask entry.

    The file-credential leg stays closed: ``.aws/config`` and ``.aws/credentials``
    are re-anchored EXPLICITLY, so the profile files whose pass-through
    ``acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap`` deleted cannot resolve inside the pod home
    either. Every other leaf in the tier is re-anchored unchanged.

    """Why a spec-declared temp *path* is refused, or ``None`` when it may be honored.

    The cause matters to the caller because only ``"sealed"`` describes a
    path inside ``<data home>/run``: an ``"unclassifiable"`` refusal is about a
    path whose canonical form could not be established, and a diagnostic that
    called it sealed would send an operator looking in the wrong place. Every
    cause gets the same response -- stop honoring the path.

    The question a caller must ask BEFORE it hands a sandboxed child a directory
    that came from config text. ``<data home>/run`` is sealed read-only
    on both backends, so a spec-declared ``TMPDIR`` under it silently gives the
    child a temp dir it cannot write -- and the write carve-out is not the answer:
    ``extra_writable_dirs`` is validated for SELF-DERIVED scratch paths only, so
    pointing it at spec text would hand untrusted config a write window under
    ``run``. A caller that gets a refusal cause must therefore stop honoring the
    path, not try to open it.

    Relative declarations are ``"unclassifiable"`` because the daemon and the
    spawned child do not share a required working directory. The classifier
    would resolve one against the daemon's cwd while ``spawn_backend`` runs the
    child under ``work_dir``. Refusing the spelling is the only way to keep one
    decision valid at every spawn boundary.

    Windows: nothing else to refuse, so ``None`` for every absolute path. Kiro Crew has no
    native Windows sandbox backend (see the delegation note in
    :func:`wrap_argv`): a probe child there is either not spawned at all or runs
    unsandboxed with a writable ``run``, so a declared temp under it is
    writable and is honored exactly as it was before this check existed. Gating
    here rather than resolving is also what keeps the check local -- on Windows
    ``realpath`` and ``stat`` OPEN the path, so classifying untrusted config
    text there would mean opening whatever it names.

    Both spellings are tested because the data home may be a supported symlink
    and path-based rules see each spelling independently. Spelling is only the
    fast answer: :func:`_identity_within_sealed_parent` then asks the filesystem
    itself, so a case, firmlink, or normalization alias of the seal cannot walk
    past this predicate.

    Blocking (``realpath``, the identity walk, plus the one-time priming of the
    runtime directories), so an async caller must reach it off the event loop.

    Its child can be made multithreaded by an ``os.register_at_fork`` handler, which
    is why :func:`_probe_unshare_via_spawn` is preferred whenever it is available.

    Mirrors the sequence ``_build_launcher_script()`` actually performs — fork,
    child ``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)``, parent writes the identity UID/GID map,
    child ``unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)`` — because the two flags do NOT behave the
    same way when combined. A single ``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNS)`` is
    satisfied atomically and therefore SUCCEEDS on hosts where the split
    sequence fails: with Ubuntu's ``kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns
    = 1`` (the default since 23.10), creating a user namespace moves the process
    into a restricted AppArmor profile carrying no CAP_SYS_ADMIN, so the
    *second* unshare returns EPERM. The previous combined probe reported those
    hosts as sandbox-capable and every real spawn then died with
    ``sandbox: unshare(NEWNS) failed: errno 1``.

    ``reason`` names the failing step so a caller can tell the mechanisms apart
    — a NEWNS denial is the AppArmor userns restriction, whereas NEWUSER with
    ENOSPC/EUSERS is ``user.max_user_namespaces=0`` — rather than reporting a
    bare errno that fits both.

    Linux-only and off-loop only: ``_probe_unshare()`` guards the platform and

    pipe reads and ``waitpid`` here never block the event loop.

# site processing enabled, ``site`` executes code from env-derived paths at startup
# -- user-site ``.pth`` files (whose location comes from ``PYTHONUSERBASE``, else
# ``HOME``) and ``sitecustomize`` (from ``PYTHONPATH``). For a config-declared
# server ``env`` block that is externally authorable text, so it is arbitrary code
# running unconfined. No argv[0] pin helps: the interpreter is the pinned binary.
#   -I (isolated) ignores PYTHON* startup vars and drops the script dir from
#      sys.path; implies -E and -s.
#   -S skips ``site`` altogether, which is what closes the class rather than
#      individual keys -- no .pth and no sitecustomize run at all.
# Safe because the generated launcher imports stdlib only (sys, os, stat, struct,

    ``extra_writable_dirs`` exists for exactly one purpose: a caller that hands
    a child its private scratch directory INSIDE the sealed runtime parent
    (``<data home>/run``, kept read-only via :func:`_voice_runtime_parent_paths`)
    needs that one directory writable — the MCP probe's ``TMPDIR`` lives at
    ``run/mcp-tmp/<probe>`` and a Bun-packaged server must extract its native
    module there before it can answer the handshake. Everything else stays
    sealed.

    Both sandbox backends apply the carve-out with override semantics (Seatbelt
    is last-match-wins; the Linux launcher remounts a fresh bind read-write), so
    an unvalidated path here would re-open whatever it covers. Each candidate is
    therefore checked, in BOTH its lexical and canonical spelling (the data home
    may be a supported symlink, and path-based rules see each spelling
    independently), against every seal the profile emits:

    * it must lie inside a ``carveable_parents`` entry — the runtime parent's
      write-only seal is the ONLY seal this parameter may punch through;
    * no guard (``subtree_guards`` — read-hidden trees, read-only ceilings,
      the voice runtime — or ``literal_guards`` — sealed single files, rename
      guards) may equal the carve-out or live inside it, since the override
      would re-open that guard;
    * it may not sit inside a non-carveable subtree guard, so a read-hidden
      tree can never grow a writable window.

    A candidate that fails any check is SKIPPED with a security warning rather
    than raising: the callers treat temp containment as fail-open hygiene, and
    a refused carve-out degrades to today's sealed behavior instead of blocking
    the spawn. Returns the deduplicated approved spellings.

    Two scope notes. Comparisons are LEXICAL and case-sensitive: on a
    case-insensitive filesystem (default APFS) a differently-cased spelling of
    a guard would not match, so this validator is a backstop for the
    self-derived paths its callers pass — paths whose case matches the emitted
    rules by construction — not a boundary for hostile input, which must never
    reach this parameter. And the ``realpath``/``isdir`` calls here are safe
    despite the no-filesystem-IO-on-the-event-loop rule the profile builders
    cite: every async caller reaches those builders through
    ``shielded_prepare_off_loop``'s worker thread.

    come from a config-declared server ``env`` block. Redirecting ``env`` does not

    receives the very credentials (Slack tokens, owner id) the ``-u`` flags exist
    to strip, and can exfiltrate them. Pinning is therefore load-bearing on these
    paths even though they intentionally apply no OS confinement of our own.

    ``trusted_system_bin`` ignores ``os.environ`` PATH entirely (fixed system dirs
    only); the ``/usr/bin/env`` fallback matches the idiom already used by
    ``sandbox_exec_argv`` and ``cgroup_scope_argv`` so an unusual host layout
    still yields an absolute path rather than a redirectable bare name.

    Deliberately does NOT pin the inner command: that is the operator's agent or
    server binary (``kiro-cli``, ``npx``, ...), which legitimately must be found on
    PATH, and it carries the same config-file trust level as the ``env`` block
    itself -- an author who can set PATH can already set ``command`` directly, so

    """Entry names of sandbox mount sources referenced by a live mount, plus
    whether the scan positively covered every namespace a PROCESS could be
    binding one from.

    A bind mount records its source as the ``root`` field (field 4) of a
    ``/proc/<pid>/mountinfo`` line, and the staged sources are direct children
    of a tmpfs root, so the basename of that field is the staged entry's name
    (mkdtemp names carry no spaces, so mountinfo's octal escaping never
    applies to them). Only prefix-shaped basenames are collected — a foreign
    mount whose root merely resembles a path cannot pin anything. Keying is by
    basename, so two identically-named entries on different roots would share
    a pin; mkdtemp's random suffix makes that vanishingly rare, and the error
    lands on the retention side.

    The launcher's mounts live in the sandboxed child's PRIVATE namespace —
    invisible in the gateway's own mountinfo — and that namespace can outlive
    the launcher pid through any surviving descendant (a build daemon, for
    example), so every readable pid's mountinfo is consulted. Coverage is
    what makes the answer usable, and it is established positively:

    - The listing must show pid 1. ``hidepid``/``subset=pid`` procfs hides
      other users' processes entirely — including a root holder that entered
      a sandbox namespace — and pid 1 always exists, so its absence proves
      the listing is filtered and the scan reports incomplete. It still reads
      every pid the filtered listing DOES show (this uid's own processes are
      never hidden from it, and every sandbox descendant keeps this uid), so
      the pins a visible holder contributes reach the caller regardless: the
      directory gate honours ``pinned`` before any other evidence.
    - A holder can fork a successor and exit between the pid listing and its
      own mountinfo read (the read then raises FileNotFoundError). The
      successor was forked BEFORE the exit, so it is visible to the very next
      listing: the scan re-lists after any pass that observed a vanish, and
      finishes on a pass that saw none. A pid appearing WITHOUT a vanish
      needs no rescan — it is either in a namespace whose surviving holders
      this scan already read, or in a brand-new namespace, which can only
      bind brand-new (fresh, live-pid) entries that are never reclaim
      candidates in the same sweep. A scan still churning after
      ``_PIN_SCAN_MAX_PASSES`` cannot prove coverage and reports incomplete.
      (A successor recycled onto an already-seen pid NUMBER inside this
      window escapes the re-listing; that needs the full pid space to wrap
      within the scan's milliseconds, and the residual error is
      retention-side only on the next sweep.)
    - A read failure is forgiven in two cases and counts as a coverage gap
      otherwise. ``EINVAL`` says that TASK has no ``nsproxy``, which is not yet
      a statement about the NAMESPACE: a thread-group leader can exit through
      ``pthread_exit`` while sibling threads keep running, and threads share the
      nsproxy, so a live namespace can sit behind a zombie leader while
      ``proc_root`` — which lists only leaders — shows nothing else to scan. So
      the group is consulted through ``/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/mountinfo``, with
      exactly two outcomes per sibling and no third: one that READS contributes
      pins and nothing else, and one that does not read, for ANY reason,
      makes coverage unprovable. Departed siblings are counted rather than
      excused, because one exiting between the listing and its read may have
      spawned a successor THREAD first, and a thread is invisible to the outer
      re-listing (which enumerates thread-group leaders only), so no re-listing
      can recover it. Tasks in one group can also hold DIFFERENT mount
      namespaces, since a thread may ``unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)``, so a readable
      sibling never speaks for an unreadable one. When every sibling reads, the
      leader's own departure still makes this a vanish, because a departing task
      may have handed its namespace to a PROCESS forked after this pass's
      listing and only a re-listing can see that. A LIVE leader that could be a
      holder (this uid's, the overflow uid's, root's) has its siblings read the
      same way, since a thread can ``unshare(CLONE_FS)`` + ``setns`` into a
      namespace its leader is not in; a sibling that departed mid-read has its
      whole group re-read on the next pass, one that would not read for any
      other reason makes coverage unprovable. Any OTHER errno on the leader
      is forgiven only when the pid provably belongs to a DIFFERENT real user
      (its ``/proc/<pid>`` stats to a uid that is not ours, not root, and not
      the host's overflow uid) — such a process cannot be binding a source this
      uid staged, because the sandboxed child keeps this uid and NO_NEW_PRIVS.
      Root can enter any namespace, and a holder in a foreign user namespace
      stats as the overflow uid, so those count as coverage gaps.

    A namespace held only by an nsfs fd or a bind-mounted ``ns/mnt`` — zero
    member processes — has no mountinfo to scan and is out of scope; the
    launcher never creates one. ``complete=False`` means absence-of-pin was
    NOT established host-wide. When the caller passes ``coverage``, the scan
    also answers the narrower question the directory gate needs
    (:class:`_PinScanCoverage`): whether every task that could be a launcher
    descendant — this uid's and the overflow uid's — was read, with none
    departing between the final listing and its read. Root's tasks count as
    possible holders too (root can ``nsenter`` any namespace), so a hidden or
    unreadable root task — a filtered procfs included — lowers coverage along
    with ``complete``; another user's unreadable or departing task lowers only
    ``complete``.

def _cleanup_stale_sandbox_mount_sources(*, roots: Sequence[str] | None = None) -> int:
    """Reclaim orphaned bind-mount sources staged by the namespace launcher.

    The launcher stages one empty dir per SENSITIVE_DIRS entry, one empty file
    per SENSITIVE_FILES entry, and (strict only) an SSH shadow dir holding a
    known-hosts copy, all named ``kirocrew_sb_<pid>_*`` on a tmpfs root. The
    kernel pins each source while its bind-mount lives, so the launcher cannot
    remove them and they orphan when the sandboxed process exits. Left alone
    they exhaust the runtime tmpfs (``/run/user/$UID``), at which point the
    systemd user manager cannot allocate transient scope units and every
    ``systemd-run --scope``-wrapped spawn fails.

    An entry becomes a reclaim candidate when its embedded pid is dead, or
    past ``_MOUNT_SOURCE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`` (the backstop for a pid recycled
    onto an unrelated live process — routine on a ``pid_max=32768`` host).
    What a candidate's removal may touch is then decided by kind, because a
    bind source is NOT protected by the kernel against the sweeper: removing
    it succeeds from this namespace (mountinfo then shows ``//deleted``), a
    removed source DIRECTORY leaves the live mount's root inode ``S_DEAD`` so
    every create under the masked path fails from then on, and a non-empty
    dir's contents are visible inside any namespace still binding it:

    - Plain files: ``os.remove``. A file source's inode is held by the mount
      like an open descriptor, so the masked view is unaffected.
    - Dirs, empty or not: removed only when no readable mount namespace
      references the entry (:func:`_mount_pinned_source_names`) AND absence
      of a pin is positively established — by the scan proving it covered
      every namespace on the host, OR by it having read every task that
      could hold one (:class:`_PinScanCoverage`: this uid's, the overflow
      uid's and root's tasks, none unreadable, none departed between the
      final listing and its read). The second is what this fix adds. The
      host-wide flag also drops for another user's unreadable or departing
      task, which cannot be holding a source this uid staged (the sandboxed
      child keeps this uid with NO_NEW_PRIVS; only root can enter a foreign
      namespace), and requiring it alone is what stranded the directory
      class permanently on the hosts this sweep exists for (observed:
      929,540 dirs retained against 511 files reclaimed, the runtime tmpfs
      back at 100% of its inodes and every spawn failing again). A recycled
      pid reads live yet has no mount, so its entry is still reclaimed after
      the age backstop rather than stranded, while a genuine long-lived
      sandbox is pinned by its own process. A namespace no PROCESS holds has
      no mountinfo to report a pin — an fd- or bind-pinned namespace with
      zero members is out of scope, and the launcher never creates one — so
      the pin set cannot go stale in the deleting direction. The
      fresh-and-alive skip above stays load-bearing for the launcher's own
      staging window (after ``mkdtemp``, before ``mount``), when its entries
      are legitimately live and not yet pinned.

    Deliberately conservative about names: only the recognized
    ``kirocrew_sb_<pid>_`` shape with an ASCII positive pid is touched.
    Foreign ``tmp*`` names carry no liveness key and are left alone, as are
    ``kirocrew_sandbox_*`` launcher scripts, the ``kirocrew_sbprobe_*`` tmpfs
    probe, and prefix matches whose segment is not an ASCII positive decimal
    (an oversized all-digit segment IS the recognized shape — it probes
    OverflowError, reads stale, and is reclaimed). Some of these roots are
    world-writable, so a planted entry — including a deep tree built to make
    ``rmtree`` recurse — must fail toward "skip", never toward an exception
    that kills the sweep.

      that absence was POSITIVELY established (:func:`_bound_source_basenames`

      copy) — left for the human note in the issue rather than removed here;
    - the one-shot marker is stamped only by a pass that reached the end AND

    """The operator's ``agent.sandbox`` tier, for one-shot kiro-cli spawns.

    ``wrap_argv``'s ``mode`` parameter defaults to ``"auto"``, which coincides
    with the shipped ``agent.sandbox`` default but ignores what the operator
    actually configured. Where ``agent.sandbox`` is an explicit ``"off"`` —
    isolation deferred to kiro-cli's own internal sandbox, which cannot nest
    inside Kiro Crew's (macOS Seatbelt returns EPERM) — a spawn that takes the
    parameter default asks for a STRICTER tier than the operator configured. On
    a backend-less host an unclassified spawn then fail-closes while a delegated
    Kiro chat path can run; the reviewed Windows Kiro sites carry explicit
    classification, but keeping the configured tier remains the cross-platform rule.

    Passing the configured value is what keeps a one-shot read from being
    stricter than the long-lived session it accompanies; it can never make it
    looser, because both resolve the same key.

    The interactive ACP spawns already thread the configured mode through their
    ``sandbox_mode`` constructor argument. The one-shot ``kiro-cli`` reads
    (``--list-models``, ``whoami``, the ``/usage`` scrape) have no such plumbing,
    so they call this instead of relying on the parameter default. Use it for a
    spawn of the SAME binary under the SAME posture as chat; it is deliberately
    not for spawns that pin their own tier on purpose (the prerequisite probes'
    ``strict``, the credential-free registry clones).

    Read lazily, like the two opt-in predicates above, to avoid an import cycle
    with the config loader. Falls back to :data:`_SANDBOX_MODE_FALLBACK` so an
    unreadable config cannot silently loosen isolation. Governance still clamps
    the result UP inside ``wrap_argv`` (:func:`_clamp_sandbox_mode`), so an
    enterprise ``sandbox.min_level`` floor overrides this value as it does any
    other caller-supplied mode.

    The generic "install a sandbox backend, or opt out" advice is actively

    a backend exists and is one AppArmor profile away from working. Worse, the
    only concrete thing that text suggests is the opt-out, which turns off the
    isolation the message exists to protect.

    The remedy differs by HOW Kiro Crew was launched, so it is named per shape:

    * AppImage / desktop app — nothing applies a profile to a directly launched
      binary, so attach one to it (``kirocrew sandbox install-profile``).
    * anything else on such a host — the profile must be applied by systemd
      (``kirocrew service install``), because the only executable in a foreground
      launch is a shared interpreter and attaching there would grant unprivileged
      userns to every Python process on the machine.

    Deliberately does NOT tell the user to set the sysctl to 0: that trades a
    kernel-wide protection for one app's need, and the per-application profile
    exists so they do not have to.

    The ``sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec`` opt-out is still named in every case,
    because it is the documented escape hatch and withholding it would leave a
    stuck user with no way out. What changes is the ORDER: on a host where the
    sandbox is one profile away from working, the profile is the remedy and the

    verification is not sandboxed on every platform (``_run_process`` skips the

    for the ``cc``/``strict`` tiers; on the default ``auto``/``standard`` tier
    they are left in place. The production ACP spawn paths
    (:meth:`AcpRuntime._spawn` / :meth:`AcpClient._spawn`) copy a raw
    ``os.environ`` and call :func:`wrap_argv` directly (not
    :func:`sandboxed_spawn_argv`), so without this scrub the channel credentials
    would be inherited by the agent subprocess on the default tier — reachable
    via ``env`` / ``os.environ`` and usable to control those channel identities
    outside KiroCrew.

    Unlike :func:`scrub_env`, this deliberately does NOT strip
    ``_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES`` (AWS/SSH/GPG): the ``standard`` sandbox is
    designed to leave git-over-SSH, the AWS CLI and kubectl usable, so those
    vars must survive the parent scrub. Prefix match via ``startswith`` mirrors
    the launcher's ENV_PREFIXES check.

    Wraps *argv* with the OS-level sandbox (:func:`wrap_argv`) AND returns a

    both the filesystem-isolation and the environment-hiding layer without
    having to remember to apply each separately. This is the wrapper the
    subprocess-spawn audit test (``test/test_spawn_audit.py``) requires every
    agent-influenced spawn in ``src/kiro_crew`` to route through.

    Args:
        argv: Original command + args.
        mode: Sandbox mode passed to :func:`wrap_argv` (default ``"standard"``:
            hides non-workflow credential dirs while leaving git-over-SSH and
            the AWS CLI usable).
        env: Base environment to scrub (default ``os.environ``). Pass a
            pre-augmented env (e.g. with a resolved ``PATH``) to have the scrub
            applied on top of it.
        strip_python_env: Strip ``PYTHONPATH``/``PYTHONHOME`` so a foreign
            Python child does not inherit KiroCrew's interpreter paths. Applied
            BOTH inside :func:`wrap_argv`'s launcher AND to the returned env, so
            the strip holds even on the fail-open path where no launcher runs.
        extra_hidden_dirs: Additional absolute directory trees the caller needs
            hidden in both the macOS Seatbelt and Linux namespace profiles.
        extra_visible_dirs: Trusted paths that must remain visible when an
            otherwise-hidden parent contains them.
        extra_writable_dirs: Self-derived scratch directories inside the sealed
            runtime parent that the child must be able to write — see
            :func:`wrap_argv`. Validated; refused candidates degrade to the
            sealed behavior rather than blocking the spawn.
        is_kiro_cli: Threaded to :func:`wrap_argv`. Whether the child carries
            its own internal sandbox, which cannot nest inside Crew's. Exposed
            here so a DELEGATING spawn can route through this chokepoint instead
            of calling :func:`wrap_argv` directly: without it, such a caller had
            to choose between the chokepoint (and silently lose the delegation
            decision, asking for a tier the child cannot honour) and its own
            hand-rolled wrap+scrub+scope (and drift from the contract every other
            spawn gets). ``None`` keeps ``wrap_argv``'s own classification.
        first_party_fixed_argv: Threaded to :func:`wrap_argv`. True ONLY for
            spawns whose full argv is derived inside this package with zero
            agent/repo/user-config influence; every passing site must be
            allowlisted in ``test/test_spawn_audit.py::FIRST_PARTY_SPAWNS``.
            See :func:`wrap_argv` for the no-backend carve-out it gates.

    Returns:
        ``(wrapped_argv, scrubbed_env, cleanup_path_or_None)``. The caller MUST
        pass *scrubbed_env* as the subprocess ``env=`` and unlink *cleanup_path*

    is a temp launcher/profile the CALLER must unlink after the child exits.

    Every async caller reaches the sync chokepoint through a worker hop.
    Cancelling that hop abandons the returned tuple while the worker still
    materializes the launcher/profile, leaking the temp file forever.  Shielding
    the hop keeps the worker's result recoverable: on cancellation we wait for
    the thread to settle, unlink the launcher it created, and re-raise.

    A REPEAT cancellation landing on a bare recovery ``await`` is a
    ``BaseException`` that would abandon the recovery before the unlink runs,
    leaking the materialized launcher.  The settle-then-unlink therefore
    runs as its own task, shielded from cancellations aimed at this caller; each
    absorbed repeat is ``uncancel()``-ed so an enclosing ``asyncio.timeout``
    still reports ``TimeoutError``, and the ORIGINAL cancellation is re-raised
    once the launcher is gone.

    ``executor`` keeps pool choice with the CALLER, because which pool absorbs a
    wedged preparation is per-site policy, not a shield concern: the chokepoint
    can cold-probe the sandbox backend with a synchronous subprocess, and

    a probe cannot occupy the workers another subsystem (the orphan-reaping
    sweep) needs.  Defaulting it to ``None`` — the loop's default pool, via

    For resolving a command when the child's working directory is pinned by

      ``.``, ``tools``) is resolved against the pinned directory, which is the
      one place the pin says not to trust by name.
    * **Identity** (when *chdir_fd* is given) -- an absolute entry that IS the
      pinned directory, or lives anywhere beneath it, is dropped too.
      ``PATH=/home/me/.kiro/crew/workspace/bin:/usr/bin`` passes the lexical
      screen unchanged, yet a binary planted behind such an entry wins the
      child's own later lookup the moment the shim has entered the pinned
      directory. Entries are compared by ``(st_dev, st_ino)`` ancestry walked

      the pinned directory cannot dodge the screen. A kept entry is emitted as

      contribute a resolvable binary today, and dropping is the direction that
      cannot be gamed by making a directory un-``stat``-able.

    When the BOUND descriptor's own identity cannot be read there is nothing to
    compare entries against, so the lexical screen stands alone for that spawn.
    That is a deliberate degrade, not a silent fallback: in production
    ``chdir_fd`` always originates from a real opened directory descriptor, and
    one that cannot be ``fstat``-ed is one the shim's own ``fchdir`` rejects
    before any command runs.

    The drop-in replacement for ``create_subprocess_exec(..., preexec_fn=
    resource_limit_preexec())``. Every keyword argument is forwarded untouched
    except ``preexec_fn``, which this owns: passing one would reintroduce the fork
    hazard the shim exists to remove, so it is refused.

    The returned ``Process`` describes the command itself, not a wrapper -- the
    shim ``exec``s in place -- so ``pid``, ``returncode``, signal delivery, and
    ``platform_compat.kill_process_tree`` all behave as they did before.

    ``chdir_fd`` pins the child's working directory to a directory IDENTITY
    rather than to a name: the descriptor is inherited, the shim ``fchdir``s into
    it and closes it, and only then is the command exec'd. Callers pass it when a
    pathname re-resolved in the child could be retargeted between the check and
    the chdir. It is deliberately not spelled ``cwd="/dev/fd/<n>"`` -- that is a
    Linux-only trick, and macOS refuses ``chdir()`` on those entries (``EACCES`` or
    ``ENOTDIR`` depending on the OS version). It needs the shim, and is refused rather than quietly downgraded
    to ``cwd``'s pathname when the shim is missing: entering a name nobody
    re-verified would reopen the window the descriptor exists to close.

    Setting it also DROPS ``cwd`` from the spawn, since ``Popen`` would otherwise
    chdir that pathname in the fork child before the shim ever runs, and screens
    ``PATH`` by directory IDENTITY -- for the search that resolves a bare command
    name here AND for the child's own environment. Relative entries are dropped
    (``execvpe`` resolved them against the child's cwd, the directory this
    descriptor exists to distrust), and so is any absolute entry that is the
    pinned directory itself or lives beneath it, compared by ``(st_dev, st_ino)``
    ancestry rather than by pathname. Resolving ``argv[0]`` is not the last
    lookup that happens: the wrapper this spawns looks its own target up on
    ``PATH`` after the shim has entered that directory. ``PATH=.:/usr/bin`` --
    or the same directory spelled absolutely -- would otherwise exec a binary
    out of the agent's own workspace, ahead of the sandbox meant to contain it.

    A spawn landing while the launcher interpreter's install tree is being
    rebuilt is retried, on the same budget and by the same discriminator as
    :func:`popen_limited` -- this wrapper puts the same ``sys.executable`` at
    the head of the spawned argv, so it was exposed to the identical blip. The
    backoff uses ``asyncio.sleep``: a blocking sleep would freeze the event loop
    for up to ~3.75s, which is precisely the hazard this wrapper exists to
    avoid. Only the shim-prefixed spawn is retried -- the no-shim fallback below
    execs the caller's own ``argv[0]``, so an ENOENT there is the caller's own
    missing binary and must still surface on the first attempt.

    There is deliberately no ``abort_retry`` hook here, unlike
    :func:`popen_limited`: no caller mediates this wrapper's cancellation
    through a registry keyed on the live child, so the lost-cancel window that
    hook exists to close has no consumer. Add one when a caller needs it.

        # own:
        #
        # (a) `cwd` leaves the spawn. ``Popen`` chdirs it in the fork child BEFORE it
        #     execs the shim, so leaving it in place would resolve the very pathname
        #     the descriptor exists to bypass -- and fail the spawn outright
        #     (EACCES/ENOENT/ENOTDIR) if that name was removed or retargeted since the
        #     bind, with the pinned descriptor never reached.
        # (b) The search below gets no cwd and a PATH screened by directory IDENTITY:
        #     relative entries are dropped, and so is any absolute entry that IS the
        #     pinned directory or lives beneath it -- compared by (st_dev, st_ino)
        #     ancestry, so an alias cannot dodge it; kept entries are re-spelled from
        #     the verified descriptor, so a retargetable symlink in the caller's
        #     spelling cannot redirect the child's later lookup. A bare name IS the
        #     normal shape here -- the macOS sandbox wrapper hands back "env" as
        #     argv[0] and the Linux cgroup wrapper hands back "systemd-run" -- so the
        #     search cannot simply be refused, and `execvpe` resolved a relative entry
        #     against the child's cwd, i.e. the pinned workspace. An absolute entry
        #     pointing INTO that workspace reaches the same binary by a different
        #     spelling.
        # (c) The CHILD gets that same screened PATH. Resolving argv[0] here is
        #     not the last resolution that happens: `env` looks `sandbox-exec` up on
        #     PATH itself, inside the child, after the shim has already entered the
        #     workspace. Narrowing only (b) left `PATH=.:/usr/bin` exec'ing a
        #     `sandbox-exec` the agent dropped in its own workspace -- ahead of the
        #     sandbox that was supposed to contain it. One sanitized PATH, used for
        #     both, is what makes the invariant hold rather than move down a level.

    process, and the child still inherits a duplicate of every open fd until it
    ``exec``s. Taking ``preexec_fn`` out of the picture removes both.

    ``CompletedProcess.args`` and the ``cmd`` of a ``CalledProcessError`` /
    ``TimeoutExpired`` are the command's own argv, not the shim's. That is
    maintained here rather than free: the shim source rides in argv as a ~8 KB
    ``-c`` string, and both exceptions render ``cmd`` into their message, so

    :func:`popen_limited`: this wrapper never hands back a handle, so no

    The returned ``Popen`` is the command's own process, not a wrapper's, so

    ``Popen.args`` is reset to the command's own argv for the same reason
    :func:`run_limited` rewrites ``cmd``: ``communicate(timeout=...)`` builds its
    ``TimeoutExpired`` from ``self.args``, so leaving the shim there would put
    ~8 KB of shim source into the timeout message. Nothing in CPython reads
    ``self.args`` functionally -- only ``__repr__`` and that exception.

    ``abort_retry`` is consulted after each backoff, and matters only to a caller
    whose cancellation is mediated by a REGISTRY keyed on the live child -- for
    those, the backoff is a window in which a cancel is silently LOST rather than
    merely delayed, because the canceller finds no registered child and records
    nothing, and the retry then launches work the caller already cancelled.
    Returning ``True`` re-raises the ENOENT instead of spawning, so the caller's
    own cancellation path reports the run rather than running it. A caller that
    holds the ``Popen`` handle itself and polls a stop flag (such as
    ``auto_improvement.spine.agent_runner``, which calls ``_terminate_group`` on
    the handle) loses nothing by omitting it: the stop is observed after the
    spawn returns and the child is signalled then.
